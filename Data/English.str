[EnemyReport0] The Drengin are an evil, ruthless race that have been united for over 100 millennia.  They make use of slave labor and the life of a slave is nothing to them: the slightest misstep will purchase a one-way ticket to the "death furnace" for the unfortunate slave.
[EnemyReport2] The Arceans are a proud, warrior race who first gave Humanity the technology to create a star gate.  They are the Terrans' primary source of knowledge about the Drengin and the mysterious "Precursors".
[EnemyReport1] The Altarians look exactly like Terrans, judging by their communications with humanity. However, no Terrans have actually met an Altarian, so it is possible that they are carrying on a massive deception.  They appear to possess supernatural powers.
[EnemyReport3] The Torians were once conquered by the Drengin, but eventually threw off the Drengin regime and now maintain a fairly neutral stance toward their former masters.  Reports about the current nature of their civilization are conflicting.
[EnemyReport4] The Yor are a non-organic life-form who are out to destroy all organic life-forms.  Little is actually known about them, but they are thought to have once been mere machines used by the Precursors that developed sentience.

[0Report_Good_Dumb] The %s are a happy go lucky civilization whose motto is "Let's all just take a nap." Rumors have it that a dark Arnorian (who we believe to be the race of the Precursors) visited them and threw up his hands in disgust and left. They are a charming if a bit daft civilization.

[0Report_Good_Average] The %s are a kind and reasonably intelligent civilization. They have had space travel for eons while mankind was still trying to figure out how to fish.  One of our top anthropologists described them as friendly intelligent raptors. While they have had a massive technological head start, human recklessness seems to be a real equalizer.

[0Report_Good_Smart] The %s are an incredibly intelligent civilization. They have had space travel for eons. Their culture, until recently, held back scientific progress as dangerous. But with the advent of hyper-drive, they have shifted their resources into high gear. The %s are very likely to dominate the new galactic landscape.

[0Report_Neutral_Dumb] The %s are a bit dull and morally unconcerned with anything. They don't tend to take strong positions on anything and it doesn't really matter since they aren't likely to be able to affect the outcome of anything.

[0Report_Neutral_Average] The %s are a tricky lot, or at least they try to be. While not the sharpest sticks in the woods, they are quite formidable in a pinch. They tend to take the most pragmatic position in affairs.

[0Report_Neutral_Smart] The %s believe they will ultimately dominate the galaxy and for good reason - they are incredibly intelligent. The availability of hyper-drive has turbo charged their scientific, social and military industries to try to create a force that can dominate the galaxy. We must be very wary of them.

[0Report_Evil_Dumb] The %s are an incredibly evil, vile race that would think nothing of blasting you just for kicks. Luckily, their home planet has an incredibly high amount of lead in the crust layer which we believe has made them a bit... slow. The %s make a lot of noise but are not much of a threat.

[0Report_Evil_Average] The %s are a vile evil civilization bent on nothing but the extermination of those who oppose them. Our anthropologists believe that they will ruthlessly attempt to make good on their dreams. We must be wary.

[0Report_Evil_Smart] The %s are an incredibly evil race whose economy is supercharged by massive numbers of slaves who they have genetically bred. A brutal regimented society, the slightest misstep will purchase a one way ticket to the "death furnaces". The %s are very likely to dominate the galaxy and bring about the swift destruction of mankind if we are not very wary.


[1Report_Good_Dumb] The %s are... well they're really nice. They look remarkably like humans. Unfortunately, they seem to think nose picking is a form of communication. They're nice and harmless. We suspect that there's a bit too much lead in their planet's crust.

[1Report_Good_Average] The %s are a kind civilization that hopes to make use of hyper-drive technology to colonize the galaxy. Be wary though, they don't tolerate evil civilizations very well.

[1Report_Good_Smart] The %s are remarkably intelligent. But they tend to be a little bit self-righteous as well. We must be careful with them as the way they 'united' their planet was by 'purifying' themselves (i.e. they exterminated everyone they felt was morally corrupt).

[1Report_Neutral_Dumb] The %s are not well known. Mainly because they are... well very boring. They don't really have an opinion on anything and given their lack of intelligence, it's probably better that way.

[1Report_Neutral_Average] The %s are a tricky lot, or at least they try to be. While not the sharpest sticks in the woods, they are quite formidable in a pinch. They tend to take the most pragmatic position in affairs.

[1Report_Neutral_Smart] The %s are very intelligent. They look a lot like us and believe that we must be some sort of lost colony of theirs from ages past.

[1Report_Evil_Dumb] The %s are EVIL. But there's 'evil' and true evil. Their kind of evil is the sort of half-witted cartoon villainy.

[1Report_Evil_Average] The %s are a vile evil civilization bent on nothing but the extermination of those who oppose them. Our anthropologists believe that they will ruthlessly attempt to make good on their dreams. We must be wary.

[1Report_Evil_Smart] The %s are an incredibly evil race whose economy is supercharged by massive numbers of slaves who they have genetically bred.

[2Report_Good_Dumb] The %s are a happy go lucky civilization whose motto is "Let's all just take a nap." Rumors have it that a dark Arnorian (who we believe to be the race of the Precursors) visited them and threw up his hands in disgust and left. They are a charming if a bit daft civilization.

The %s are very likely to dominate the galaxy and bring about the swift destruction of mankind if we are not very wary.


[4Report_Good_Dumb] The %s are friendly. Or at least as friendly as a mechanical creature can be. Their brains are powered by what amounts to an 80286 level processor. And it shows.

[4Report_Good_Average] The %s are a race of cybernetic beings who hope to take control of the galaxy away from us filthy organics. They are fairly benevolent. But their programming seems to indicate that they would be quick to wipe out those they consider evil.

[4Report_Good_Smart] The %s are an incredibly sophisticated cybernetic civilization that believes it has already achieved perfection. They plan to bring their perfection to the galaxy. We must keep an eye on them.

[4Report_Neutral_Dumb] The %s are a simple machine-based form of life. Rumors have it that they are left over self-replicating servants of 'the Precursors', an ancient and powerful civilization. Beyond doing simple chores, however, they are not much of a threat.

[4Report_Neutral_Average] The %s will need to be watched. This cybernetic race could be described as amoral. They are bent on making all beings subservient to machines.

[4Report_Neutral_Smart] The %s believe they will ultimately dominate the galaxy and for good reason - they are incredibly intelligent. The availability of hyper-drive has turbo charged their scientific, social and military industries to try to create a force that can dominate the galaxy. We must be very wary of them.

[4Report_Evil_Dumb] The %s are a brutal race of machines that seem to be an ancient weapon system of the Precursors that went awry. Luckily, they are relatively simple minded and are not likely to pose much of a threat.

[4Report_Evil_Average] The %s want nothing less than to rule the galaxy. These machines believe that cybernetic organisms such as themselves are the ultimate form of life and that we must all live under their superior rule.

[4Report_Evil_Smart] The %s are a vile hyper-intelligent cybernetic race bent on conquering the galaxy. Likely the left-over weapons of an ancient Precursor civilization known as the Dark Arnor, they have evolved into truly sentient beings who will stop at nothing to exterminate all organic life.

[Report00] The %s are a spunky bunch, filled with great ideas but, unfortunately too short to accomplish many of them. \n \n The average height of the adult male is 1 meter, making them just taller than the average 8 year old human.
[Report01] A race of female dominated social groups, this civilization in its developing stages but full of promise. \n \n At the same technological level as humans in the late 20th century, the %s's determination to succeed parallels that of our ancestors.
[Report02] These guys don't know what's going on. Stuck in the same solar system for over 5,000 years, only in the last decade did they figure out how to get a vessel out of their atmosphere.  When food is lacking, the %s have been know to eat their own waste. Disturbing.
[Report03] Hippies at heart, the %s would love to do nothing more than lounge the day away in the haze of their special herb, 'oisatsana'.  \n \n Unfortunately, their environment doesn't permit any time for rest... harsh weather patterns have these guys constantly on their toes.
[Report04] Truly the brain-children of the galaxy, the %s are a quickly advancing culture.  \n \n Decades ago, after warding off an attack by the Drengin, this primal race was able to use scrapped Drengin warships to learn the basics of space travel. Since then they've jumped on the galactic bandwagon.

[Has_Completed] has completed the
[Event_Monster] Merchants report that a horrible space creature has been spotted in deep space wreaking havoc on everything it can find. Beware!
[Event_Pirates] As the galaxy grows in commerce, so too does the criminal fringe. There are now roving pirates attacking shipping and outposts.
[Event_Pirates2] With the decay of certain civilizations, some of their former officers have taken to a life of crime. They now pray on ships of all kinds throughout the galaxy. We must be wary of them as they can destroy vital shipping.
[Event_MoralUprising_Foreign] A revolution has occurred within the %s. The people of that civilization have risen up in protest of the 'evil' ways of their leaders. They have taken to the streets and eventually wrested control of part of their empire. They have vowed to wipe the galaxy clean of evil! They are calling themselves the %s.
[Event_MoralUprising_Human] Mr. President, we have bad news. Some misguided religious fanatics have managed to covertly organize and overthrow the governors of some of our planets. They say that the %s has gone down a dark path and needs to be rescued. They've vowed to cleanse the universe of all evil, starting with us! They have named themselves the %s.
[Event_Insult_Alien] During a tour of the capital city of the %s, the ambassador from the %s accidentally insulted the leader of the %s. The controversy has since spiraled into a full scale war between them! Some believe that if they had invested some resources into espionage they would have been able to learn more about the culture of their hosts and have avoided this.
[Event_Insult_Human] Last week our ambassador was visiting the home world of the %s. During the dinner, he mistakenly insulted the mistress of their leader. Tensions have spiraled out of control and this morning we received a note from the %s that only war would teach us manners. Critics of our administration have argued that if we had only spent some resources on espionage that this could have been averted by greater understanding of their culture.
[Event_Assasinate_Alien] Last month on a good will tour on the planet %s, the President of the %s was murdered by a radical terrorist group that is based in the %s. It is opposed to the 'ethical' positions of that leader. The situation has spun out of control and the two civilizations are now at war with one another.
[Event_Assasinate_Human] Last weekend the leader of the %s was on planet %s to oversee the negotiation of a trade agreement between our largest corporation and their government. While there, a disgruntled former worker shot and killed %s! A new leader has taken his place and has vowed revenge on us! War has been declared! Worse, arms have been given to the %s by private sources!
[Event_UniteAgainstEvil_1] Travelers report that there is a growing religious movement in the galaxy. This movement is made up of self-confessed 'fanatics' whose dream is to wipe all evil out of the galaxy. They are gaining considerable power in foreign governments. This is something we should probably keep an eye on.
[Event_UniteAgainstEvil_2] There has been a galaxy wide revolution of alien governments as various civilizations have concluded that all evil must be wiped out. They claim that our civilization is evil and must be destroyed!
[Event_Recession_1] An interstellar recession seems to be upon us. Reports from across the galaxy indicate that all civilizations are seeing a significant decrease in the economic activity on their worlds.
[Event_Recession_2] The interstellar recession seems to have moved off as tax revenues are returning to normal.
[Event_BoomEconomy_1] We have entered into a period of enhanced economic activity. Entrepreneurs and industrialists throughout the galaxy are experiencing great success. Tax revenue is much higher than it was before. We expect the economy to continue to climb for awhile!
[Event_BoomEconomy_2] The economic boom we've been experiencing seems to be over. The economy is slowly returning to more historic rates. Economists predict that in a few more months things will be completely back to normal.
[Event_Xenophobia_1] A wave of xenophobia is running through the galaxy. There seems to be a massive back lash towards anything that seems foreign. We should keep a close eye on this.
[Event_Xenophobia_2] The period of xenophobia seems to be ebbing as cultural exchange centers throughout the galaxy are reporting a renewed interest in learning about the ideas and lifestyles of other cultures.
[Event_Xenophile_1] There seems to be a great interest in all things foreign. Our people are increasing their interest in learning about interstellar cultures. Merchants report that this trend is galaxy wide. Does this spell the beginning of a new era? Your Cultural influence has increased.
[Event_Xenophile_2] The reign of the xenophiles is at an end. So says a new report from the Institute for Traditional Ideas. While people are starting to be interested again in the ideas of other cultures, but nowhere to the level that they once were.
[Event_DarkArnor_1] Legend has it that hundreds of thousands of years ago there was a world called Arnor. On this world were a race known as the Precursors.\n \n Supposedly, there was a war between two factions of them. On the one side were the ones who called themselves the 'Arnor' and on the other side the ones known as the Dread Lords. The final battle between them was known as the cataclysm. And in that battle the Dread Lords were trapped in a crystal known as the Telenanth. There are rumors that a small religious sect is looking for a 'key' to unlock this crystal and set them free. This is surely something we must keep an eye on.
[Event_DarkArnor_2] We have learned more about this religious sect. They are looking for an orb. Our agents are on the case trying to track them down and stop them.
[Event_DarkArnor_3] Our agents have located the religious sect. After a fierce fire fight on the planet %s our agents have lost. Our espionage efforts were apparently not high enough to stop this religious sect and now they have used this orb to unlock a crystal that contained the frozen Precursor armies known as the 'Dread Lords'. \n \n They have seized control of the planet and seem almost unstoppable! They have sent a message to every civilization: YOUR TIME IS OVER. YOU WILL ALL BE EXTERMINATED.
[Event_DarkArnor_4] Our security agents have stopped this religious sect from acting. Thankfully we had done enough espionage work across the galaxy to locate their chain of command and discover their terrible plans!
[Event_NewShip_1] Meanwhile... \n \n The %s have uncovered an ancient ship while scouting over the wastelands of one of its planets. This ship, left over from the Precursors, was one of their 'light' cruisers. It's been dubbed a 'Ranger' class starship by our experts.
[Event_NewShip_2] Our scientists on planet %s have found a fully functional starship. It has immense weapons and technology and is known as a 'Ranger' class starship.
[Event_Terrorism_1] One of our starbases has been sabotaged! The %s starbase located in sector %d, %d was the target of a terrorist plot. Our agents report that if we had invested more in espionage with the various civilizations that we would have been able to prevent this.
[Event_Terrorism_2] Our spies have uncovered a plot by the %s to destroy our starbases. Thankfully our espionage budget was high enough to stop this!
[Event_Draginol_1] There are rumors on planet %s that an evil force is growing there. Experts say that something terrible is going to happen there. But no one is sure exactly what. Some members of the senate are suggesting that we abandon that colony.
[Event_Draginol_2] An evil force has seized control of %s. In fact the entire star system is now under its control. This dark being is rumored to be called 'Draginol', a creature that archeologists say is a mythical being that supposedly created a race of beings known as the Precursors. We don't know his plans but he has summoned forth an incredible military ability and seems to be emanating a sense of fear as morale on our worlds (and elsewhere) seems to be affected. \n \n The only way to end this is to use our efforts to wipe out this enemy.
[Event_Draginol_3] The evil force that has been plaguing the galaxy has been destroyed! The last planet under the control of Draginol has been wiped out and the galaxy can breathe a sigh of relief.
[Event_NewShip_3] The %s have uncovered several ancient ships left over from the Precursors. They have been classified as Corvette-class starships.
[Event_NewShip_4] Scientists on planet %s have found several fully functional starships. They have been classified as Corvette-class starships.
[Event_EvilMustDie_1] A galactic movement against all things deemed 'evil' has quickly turned into a full-blown revolution. A new civilization known as the %s has been created. These fools have overthrown the rightful over lords of several of our worlds. We must crush them.
[Event_EvilMustDie_2] A galactic movement against all things considered 'evil' has turned into a full-blown revolution. They call themselves the %s. Several worlds from other civilizations have overthrown their evil tyrants and joined them. Thankfully, none of our worlds wished to defect.
[Event_Omnicron] A new type of thinking machine has been invented and has spread across the galaxy. This has had the effect of greatly increasing our research ability as well as that of other civilizations!
[Event_UltraDrive] Just as hyper-drive revolutionized the galaxy, a new type of interstellar travel has been invented - UltraDrive. The net effect is that all ships have seen 50 percent increases in their speed!
[Event_HyperSensors] An incredible new technology has spread across the galaxy. Hyper sensors. This technology has made it possible to vastly increase our sensor range.
[EVENT_Calor_1] Travelers report that a new civilization calling themselves the %s has been formed.
[EVENT_Calor_2] Reports from the planet %s indicate that a terrorist group calling themselves the %s have poisoned the %s planet %s. Its atmosphere has been severely damaged. It has become a class 10 planet! Millions will die! Experts say the only way to stop this is to wipe out the %s.
[EVENT_Calor_3] Reports are coming in that a group calling themselves the %s have opened up a fissure in the fabric of space and allowed space creatures from other dimensions in. Havoc is certain to ensue! Our agents say that only the destruction of the %s can stop them from wreaking havoc.
[EVENT_Calor_4] There are rumors that the Calorians have now created a genetic virus that is greatly increasing birth defects. Population growth rates have been halved for the %s. Military experts say that we must find all planets belonging to the Calorians and wipe them out!
[EVENT_Calor_Dead] The galaxy has much to rejoice today as the final destruction of the %s has eliminated a great terrorist threat from the galaxy.
[EVENT_NewCivilization] Travelers report the sighting of a new minor race known as the %s. They have colonized the star system %s.

[Event_League_1] Disenchanted citizens of several civilizations have broken off to form a new civilization called the Independent League.
[Event_League_2] The star system, %s, has left the %s in order to join the Independent League.
[Event_League_3] Our star system, %s, has defected to join the Independent League.
[Event_League_4] The rebel factions across the galaxy have joined together to form the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.
[Phoenix_1] Over the course of the last several months, forces working in secret have sought to bring about a return of the %s. Now, it appears they have been successful with several unhappy star systems joining in.
[Gaia_1] Alien Archeologists working on the planet %s have discovered that that world was once a principal planet in the ancient Precursor civilization known as the Arnor. While looking through ruins, they have uncovered a device that has turned that planet into a class 35 planet!
[Gaia_2] Our Archeologists working on the planet %s have discovered that that world was once a principal planet in the ancient Precursor civilization known as the Arnor. While looking through ruins, they have uncovered a device that has turned that planet into a class 35 planet!
[Destabilize_1] Our efforts at destabilizing the %s seem to be paying off. Not only has morale on their worlds been affected, but we managed to destroy the %s on the planet %s!
[Destabilize_2] There are rumors that the %s are conducting a campaign of sabotage and destabilization. Their government denies this but our intelligence says the evidence is mounting.
[Destabilize_3] Our intelligence operatives have infiltrated most parts of the government of the %s. Thanks to this, we were able to prove that the %s have been destabilizing us. While they officially deny such actions took place, they have agreed to pay us %d for %d years as a way of keeping the situation quiet.
[Destabilize_4] Thanks to our expertise at covert action, our operatives were able to secretly sabotage the environmental control systems of the planet %s. The result is that their base planet class has been lowered!
[Destabilize_5] Our expert covert operatives have been able to convince the star system %s to become an independent! The %s are furious but they cannot prove that the action was due to us.
[Destabilize_6] The good news is that we were able to secretly supply arms to a rebel faction within the %s. The bad news is that they have used those arms to hijack a group of ships which are now attacking everyone they can find.
[Destabilize_7] Our intelligence officers believe that the %s have thoroughly infested nearly all parts of our government. They strongly urge us to vastly increase the amount of espionage we spending to track the %s. They think something very big is about to happen.
[Destabilize_8] Thanks to increased spending on espionage, our operatives have been able to track down and... deal with the spies that were throughout our government. A dangerous conspiracy was in the works that could have brought down much of our government.
[Destabilize_9] ALERT! A vast conspiracy by unknown operatives has been executed. Key members of the senate seem to be involved in it! And in fact our very way of life is in danger. We have altered our form of government to return to imperial. The entire political establishment seems to be traitorous due to payments from unknown sources.
[Destabilize_10] ALERT! Unknown operatives have released a poison into the atmosphere of %s! As a result, the planet's class has been lowered by 3!
[Destabilize_11] ALERT! Unknown operatives have destroyed our %s on the planet %s!

[Miracle_1] Researchers from the %s have uncovered a Precursor device that has done something remarkable: Every uncolonized planet for 2 sectors in every direction from the %s system has increased its base planet class by %d!
[Miracle_2] Our Scientists in the %s system have uncovered a Precursor device that has increased the base planet class of the other planets in this star system by %d!
[Miracle_3] Scientists from the %s in the %s system have uncovered a Precursor device that has increased the base planet class of the other planets in this star system by %d!

[Espionage_1] Meanwhile... \n \n Our spies have been working closely with the minor race government of the %s. Using their unique abilities, they have been able to steal all of the technologies of the %s. \n \n This has ramifications for us because they have indicated that they are willing to trade these technologies to us for the right price. They are particularly interested in obtaining star systems from us.
[Espionage_2] Our spies report that the minor race government known as the %s has decided that it needs its day in the sun. They apparently have a vast espionage network and have put together a host of ships, weapons, and technologies with the goal of conquering the galaxy. They have even managed to get some planets from the %s to join them and have declared war on the rest of their civilization.
[Espionage_3] Our spies believe that the %s are preparing to attack the %s. They suggest that we provide arms and economic aid to the %s in order to prevent war.
[Espionage_4] Our spies have convinced all of the star systems in sector %d, %d that belong to the %s to break away and join up with the minor race known as the %s.
[Espionage_5] Our spies have managed to infiltrate the government of the %s. Thanks to their works, they have managed to get the %s to declare war on the %s!
[Espionage_6] Our intelligence sources indicate that there may be a vast conspiracy in the works to unite the galaxy against us. Because we spend so little on espionage, they haven't been able to determine who is the root of the problem.
[Espionage_7] Our expert and well funded agents have been able to determine that the %s was secretly working on a plan to unite the other civilizations against us. They were able to disrupt the plan and save us from an interstellar war of considerable magnitude.
[Espionage_8] ALERT! Our spies were unable to uncover the source of a vast conspiracy to get alien civilizations to unite against us. Today, the United Planets Security Council held an emergency session to decide what to do about us. They consider us a 'rogue' civilization that must be 'dealt with'. They voted to rid the galaxy of us by uniting together.

[Comeback_1] The evil %s have become so desperate to conquer the galaxy that they have done something monstrous. Details are sketchy but this is what we know: \n \n One of their scientists has uncovered an ancient artifact. This artifact is apparently a piece of a crystal known as the 'Telenanth'. Not much is known about this crystal. However, it is said that an ancient being known as 'Draginol' used this crystal to create the Precursors. They have sacrificed millions of their own citizens to use their 'life force' to feed this crystal. The crystal, in turn, is giving their leaders immense power to build, manufacture, and research. Our agents believe that we must act quickly as they will become increasingly powerful over time.
[Comeback_2] Reports are coming in that the waning civilization of the %s has somehow uncovered a piece of an ancient artifact that grants the one who controls it nearly unlimited power. This power grows over time. Each day, that civilization will grow increasingly powerful in numerous ways. Our agents believe that we must either act now to destroy this civilization or one day be enslaved by it.

[Event_Culture_1] Meanwhile... \n \n Demonstrations against the %s are growing across the galaxy. Accusations of 'cultural conquest' are being leveled at the %s. Merchants and shop keepers are being intimidated into only selling 'native' goods and services. The net result is that native cultural power has grown.

[Allies_1] The %s is at war with the %s. There has been much discussion in the media over our alliance treaty with the %s. The senate has confirmed that we must act to uphold our treaty of alliance. War has been declared on the %s.
[Allies_2] The %s is at war with the %s. The senate has been tortured on how to resolve this since we are allied with both of them. It has decided that for now, the best action is to remain neutral between them.

[Report_Tribute_1] Intelligence sources indicate that the %s have demanded tribute of the %s. The %s have refused.
[Report_Tribute_2] There are rumors that the %s is paying tribute to the %s as a means to maintain the peace.
[Report_Tribute_3] There's a report that the %s, who have been paying tribute to the %s, are going broke and are unable to pay more. The %s are threatening to go to war with them if they don't pay up.
[Report_Tribute_4] There's a report that the %s have rejected the tribute demands of the %s.

[Event_PlayerDies] Meanwhile... \n \n The %s have finally succumbed to the relentless power of the %s. Their last star system, %s has been taken over and occupation forces have arrived to set up a provisional government. \n \n It is the end of the %s as an independent power.

[NewEvent_PopBoom_1] Scouts report that a strange wormhole has opened up and unleashed a strange energy burst into our galaxy. We do not understand what the precise effects of this energy but for some reason, it is causing a doubling reproductive rates. We will be keeping an eye on this.
[NewEvent_PopBoom_2] The energy field that was increasing the reproductive rate of all living things across the galaxy seems to have subsided. Population growth seems to have returned to normal.
[NewEvent_Luck_1] By what some pundits are calling a stroke of luck for us, our scouts have located a Ranger class star ship, it's been put into service!


[Event_Philosophy_1] The %s have experienced a period of internal strife. The basic values of their culture have been radically changed. The new state religion now preaches kindness through strength, strong morality, and ethical treatment of all races.

[Event_Philosophy_2] The %s have had a bloody change in their philosophy. Where they were once considered amongst the most ethical, good natured civilizations, they have now found a new path - darkness, pain, and terror. A philsophy of crushing the weak and extermination of those they consider to be in their way. We will need to keep an eye on this.

[DreadLord_Description] The Dread Lords lived long before humans walked the Earth. They ruled a mythical planet known as Arnor. On this world lived the race of Precursors. The Dread Lords broke off from the main race and were convinced that they were destined to rule the galaxy. \n \n They created an Orb of power that was designed to allow them to gain incredible power and give them the ability to summon vast armies to fight at their command. \n This Orb received its energy from the life force of the other half of the Precursor civilization which called themselves 'The Arnor'. A final battle between the two threw down the rule of the Dread Lords, who were then trapped inside a piece of the mystical crystal known as the Telananth. But the cost was high for the Arnor were utterly destroyed. \n \n Now freed by foolish mortals, the Dread Lords have returned to complete their quest to control the galaxy.
[Draginol_Description] Legend has it that Draginol was one of the five Mithrilar that were created at the beginning of time by a being of immense power. These Mithrilar were guardians of the universe, charged with maintaining balance in the universe. But Draginol was different from all others. Unlike the other Mithrilar, he could sense the passage of time. As the eons passed, he slowly went mad and set out to destroy creation itself to relieve himself of the agony of existence. While this being is a shadow of its former self, it still has the ability to lure people of all races to him to serve him. He must be destroyed.

[Religion_Civ] Fundamentalists
[Religion_Description] The Fundamentalists believe that they have the answer to all of the universe's problems.

[NewCiv_Description_1] The Vegans are a multicultural society made up of different races that live in harmony. They mainly want to be left alone.
[NewCiv_Description_2] The Paridians are a fun loving society that puts pleasure above all else.
[NewCiv_Description_3] The Jarkians are a bit deviant, or so they say. While somewhat unpredictable, they are considered a very honorable race.
[NewCiv_Description_4] The Sanderons are a very liberal but well meaning civilization.
[NewCiv_Description_5] The Arvanitians are a proud race with a strong work ethic and high intellect. However, they are quick anger and take even the most unintentional slight as a mortal attack.
[NewCiv_Description_6] The Furan are a powerful but paranoid race. Rumor has it that they have developed a nearly telepathic ability which greatly enhances their intelligence ability. However, it also makes them consider every possible negative thing that could possibly happen due to each action.
[NewCiv_Description_7] The Sanderons are a happy go lucky race. Rumor has it that they are actually humans. The long lost 'Democratic party' that left Earth in the early 21st century. Drifting in hyper sleep for decades, they seem to have founded a new worker's paradise. Good luck to them.
[NewCiv_Description_8] The Debians are a friendly race that are hard to find due to only being 2 foot tall.
[NewCiv_Description_9] The Windischians are a noble race of warriors.
[NewCiv_Description_10] The Adinians are apparently all female. Their exceptionally long life span (over 1000 years) has allowed them to survive and thrive without males. Though rumor has it they search the heavens for the male aspect of their species that are allegedly called Lesperians.
[NewCiv_Description_11] The Independent League wants to rule the galaxy but is not interested in being involved in collective organizations such as the United Planets. They believe the galaxy will come to them as people discover the tyranny and misery of their native civilizations.
[Description_Terrorist] It is hard to know what their goals are other than the eventual control of the galaxy. Our agents say that they must be destroyed.

[FirstStarbase] Construction is coming along steadily on our first 'starbase'.  These massive structures will serve as a key mechanism for expanding the empire, providing necessary assistance wherever it is needed most.  Once the base itself is finalized, work can begin on the installation of starbase 'modules'.  These components will aid our people in different ways and could easily mean the difference between victory and defeat at the hands of our enemies.
[FirstTradeRoute] To ensure economic stability in the galaxy, and to further relations with other races, it's become obvious that trading will become a large part of our intergalactic expansion.  However, the races we've contacted are less than eager to build a dependency on the goods of other empires.  It'll take time and research to convince them to raise current trade restrictions on our merchants.
[FirstColony] After being trapped on Earth for thousands of years, we have finally begun colonization of our newest home.  With the invention of hyper-drive, our scientists have led the way for galactic expansion.  While most of our citizens embrace this adventurous spirit, we will also have to be wary of the dangers that lie in uncharted space.  Some races wish only to expand, others wish to dominate... through extermination. \n \n Caution is advised.
[FirstDebt] ! Caution ! \n \n The empires' treasury has reached a dangerous level. After we fall past -500 bc, it's necessary that we shift all income towards getting out of debt.  Production and Research projects will be put on hold and no more purchases will be allowed until the treasury reaches a reasonable level.
[FirstAnomaly] The galaxy is not a tidy place. We see scattered about evidence of long gone civilizations and unknown artifacts. Our survey ships can explore these anomalies and find ways for them to benefit mankind.
[FirstBattleship] Capital ships. Warfare in the galaxy will never be the same. The battleship is the first capital ship that is designed specifically for combat. We have entered a new phase of galactic warfare.
[FirstFreighterKilled] In times of war, trade ships are the first victims. Trade ships travel the path set by your freighters. The further along their path, the more revenue we receive from trade. We must protect these trade ships in order to thrive economically. Too many lost trade ships will mean the end of the trade route. Be wary.
[FirstInvasion] The invasion of a star system is an immense undertaking. Billions of troops on both sides are involved. Only complete air and space supremacy can make ground warfare on this scale possible. It is up to you to balance the lives of our soldiers with the needs of our civilization.
[FirstCloseToCWin] Our culture has reached a point where we are culturally dominating the galaxy. If this trend continues for one more year, this trend will become permanent and we will become the cultural overlord of the galaxy and humanity will be truly victorious.

[TABLEALIAS TutorialText]
[TutorialColonyShip] These special 'Colony Ships' help your empire expand, holding both the citizens and the equipment needed to build a permanent settlement on foreign planets.  First you'll want to find a decent planet to settle on.  Click on nearby stars to bring up the 'System List', which will display the planets in orbit of that star.  Once you can find a reasonable planet for our people, you can use the right mouse button to send the colonists to their new home.
[TutorialSurveyShip] Using telescopic sensors, we've seen a vast number of oddities through the galaxy.  Up until the invention of Hyper-Drive, we hadn't the technology necessary for deep-space exploration.  However, now that our ships have the required propulsion mechanics, we can send out 'Survey Ships' to examine these anomalies and see if they'll be any use to our empire.
[TutorialConstructorShip] Without the restriction of gravity, architects from around the world be engineered a way to create mammoth structures known as 'Starbases'.  Hauling crew and gear to the building site, ships known as 'Constructors' will allow you to either create a new Starbase, or build onto an existing one. Once you've reached the building site, use the Ship Data window's 'Build Starbase' button to begin construction of a new Starbase.
[TutorialFreighterShip] A new era of economic empowerment is upon us!  Using 'Freighters', you'll be able to establish trade routes with other races.  The amount received from the route is dependant on the distance traveled and your civilizations' trade ability.  \n \n Set a course to the star system of a friendly race to begin the trading process.
[TutorialTransportShip] Not just one ship, but actually a fleet of vessels engineered for planetary occupation, 'Transports' will allow you to invade the star system of an enemy race. With little defense and no offensive capabilities, it's in your best interest to send fighters to escort the Transport into enemy territory.  Transports are only able to invade undefended star systems.

[TABLEALIAS SocialNews]

[General] We have built a new social project for our people.
[WonderBuilt] The %s have built a %s, a truly unique accomplishment. One might even call it a Galactic Wonder. No further %s may be built.
[AchievementBuilt] A report has come in that the %s have built a %s.
[Defection] ALERT: The people of %s have rebelled against us. Reports are that they admire the culture of the %s more than ours and have defected to be part of their destiny!
[Defection_Alien] Reports indicate that the citizens of %s have rebelled against the %s to join up with the %s whom they feel are culturally superior.
[Defection_Warning] Sources on %s report that there is a growing secessionist movement. 'The %s just seem more culturally advanced. I just don't feel we have much in common anymore with the rest of the %s,' said one dissatisfied citizen. Either way, it's an issue that we need to look into.

[CulturalDefeat_Warning] The Cultural Integrity Bureau has informed us that our cultural identity is rapidly becoming non-existent.  Our people are finding the ideas, products and lifestyles of the %s more attractive than those of our empire.  If the influence of the %s grows any stronger, we will lose the uniqueness that makes us Terrans.

[ImpCompleted] Social Project Completed!

[TradeGoodBuilt] The Minister of Trade would like to report that the %s has developed a new trade good, %s.  They have exclusive control over its distribution, and infringement on their monopoly is prohibited.

[HelpMessage] To aid you in your valiant battle against the %s we present you with some of our finest starships.
[HelpHumanWar] We believe our destiny goes and in hand with the Humans. Therefore we are joining the war on your side against the %s.
[DefendMessage] While we have nothing personally against you humans, the fact is that your war against the %s puts our economy at risk. Therefore you must be destroyed.
[DefendHumanAlly] As your ally, we shall come to your aid against the ruthless %s.
[DefendAgainstHuman] You are at war with our ally, the %s. Therefore we regrettably must honor our agreement with them and declare war on you.
[HumanHelpsAlly] By our alliance with the %s, we must declare war on the %s.

[WarMessage_Header] A message has arrived from the %s.
[WarMessage] We're sorry to inform you, Earth-creature, that we have decided we need more breathing room. Prepare to die.
[WarMessage_altarian] We have much in common with you. And soon, your planets will be something we have in common. Prepare to become part of our Empire.
[WarMessage_arcean] We are a proud and powerful civilization. As such, we need subject worlds to worship us. Given your pitiful lack of military power, we have decided to educate you in matters of warfare from the losers perspective. Prepare to die.
[WarMessage_drengin] Our death furnaces don't power themselves you know. We've calculated that it'll be easier to fuel them with your carcasses than to mine the ore necessary to power them.
[WarMessage_torian] Our civilization was once enslaved but we broke free! This may seem like words of inspiration but what we actually mean by that is that we know how to prevent you from ever being free again. Do not resist, it will only make things harder for you.
[WarMessage_yor] Our civilization detests carbon-based life forms such as your own. Therefore we will conquer your species and then exterminate you all. Nothing personal.
[WarMessage_HumanEvil] We consider it our mission to help rid the galaxy of evil. Your civilization fits that description nicely and therefore your planets will be rid of your presence soon enough... prepare to die.

[WarMessage_altarian_good] We consider your civilization a vile, corrupt thing that must be destroyed. We are not at war with your people, only your tyrannical government. Once we occupy your worlds we can re-educate your species as to the proper ways to behave.
[WarMessage_arcean_good] Your treatment of indigenous life forms and your culture in general sickens us. We must liberate the galaxy of your evil.
[WarMessage_drengin_good] No one would accuse us of being warm and fuzzy but you people are horrible. We have launched a crusade to eliminate your civilization from the galaxy.
[WarMessage_torian_good] Your kind is exactly the evil that we have determined to fight at all costs. Prepare to be destroyed.
[WarMessage_yor_good] Our nature doesn't tend to evaluate things as good and evil. However, we have calculated that your behavior will cause a net negative effect in the galaxy should you be allowed to thrive. Therefore we have decided that your species must become extinct.



[Surrender_Message_Peace] We can no longer sustain ourselves in this hostile galaxy and have decided to surrender ourselves to the %s.
[Surrender_Message_War_Humans_Short] While we have not long been at war with you, we know that it is futile to resist you. We have decided to surrender to you.
[Surrender_Message_War_Short] This war has not gone on for long but we know we are doomed. Yet still will we spite your dreams of conquest by surrendering to the %s!
[Surrender_Message_War_Humans_Long] This war has gone on for a long while. We know that ultimately you will destroy us. We will put ourselves at your mercy and surrender to you.
[Surrender_Message_War_Long] For a long while we have warred with one another and we are slowly losing the fight. Our hatred for you is eternal so we therefore choose to surrender to the %s. May they someday sweep you into the dustbin of history.




[WelcomeMessage] So human, we meet at long last. We are the mighty %s and we have claimed these worlds in our name. Beware!
[1_WelcomeMessage_2] We welcome you to the stars, human. While it may not seem it by my looks, the %s are a friendly civilization that wish peace and love for all.
[1_WelcomeMessage_1] Hail, human traveler! The %s have made claims to many of these worlds.
[1_WelcomeMessage_0] So, this is a human. Your skin looks... delicious. We %s love good skin. I am sure in time that we will meet for dinner...

[3_WelcomeMessage_2] We are the %s, a proud and noble race. The hyper-drive technology you humans have created has created a great boom but may indeed prove perilous to us all.
[3_WelcomeMessage_1] Ah, so you are a human. The species that created the hyper-drive technology we now use to explore our galaxy. Do not get in our way though or you will earn our wrath.
[3_WelcomeMessage_0] Hmmm. So these weak, pink things are humans. This galaxy has long been explored by the %s and we will crush any who oppose us.

[2_WelcomeMessage_2] Welcome, human friend! We are the %s. We have long wanted to meet you so that we can unravel the mystery of why we look so similar. We look forward to a great friendly relationship.
[2_WelcomeMessage_1] So you're a human. We are the %s. We obviously have much in common based on our looks. We shall speak more soon.
[2_WelcomeMessage_0] We are the %s. Clearly there is some relation between your race and ours. You're obviously some sort of backward failed subset of our species. Make one false step and we will cleanse you out of existence.

[4_WelcomeMessage_2] We are the %s. Long were we enslaved by another civilization but have broken free. Your hyper-drive technology has given us new hope to make our own mark on the galaxy.
[4_WelcomeMessage_1] Hello, humans! We thank you for your hyper-drive technology. We have long since taken down our star gates and converted them into colony ships. Now we can become a major power in the galaxy!
[4_WelcomeMessage_0] We were once enslaved by a vile race that loved to eat the skin of their victims. We have learned much from them. In fact...Hmmm..Your skin looks... delicious!

[5_WelcomeMessage_2] Greetings. We are the %s. We have been programmed for peace, love, and pleasure. We hope to have a lot of contact with your species.
[5_WelcomeMessage_1] Greetings, flesh creature. The %s have made claims to many of these worlds. If we calculate that you are a threat to us, we will exterminate you.
[5_WelcomeMessage_0] Fleshling, the %s have claimed these worlds. Interfere with our plans and we will liquefy your species to spread on our toast.

[35_WelcomeMessage_2] I am the %s. And I am here as a test computer player for the beta. But I'm still going to try to kick your butt.
[35_WelcomeMessage_1] I am the %s and I'm set to neutral which means that I might decide to squash you or I might now.
[35_WelcomeMessage_0] I am the %s. I'm set to evil for this test game. That means that if given the chance, I'll grind your civilization into bone flecked jam.



[SmartAI_Warning] Look human, perhaps you are mistaking my generalship for some sort of weak video game or something. But we are most definitely keeping a close eye on your military build up.
[SmartAI_Attack] I think we're better off dealing with you before you deal with us...


[WelcomeGarbled] Smetz Keala et kula drinena est tu estharwa! [We need a Universal Translator.]
[CannotSpeak] We need a Universal Translator to speak to this civilization.

[Generic_CantMakePeace] We'd love to make peace with them. Unfortunately, they are not willing to do so. Talk to them.

[Generic_Greeting] Greetings, human. What would you like to discuss today?

[1_Sneer_1] Gak. What in the farg do you pathetic humans want?
[1_Sneer_2] Good snarf, what do you want? There's a game on that I really wanted to watch...
[1_Sneer_3] What pearls of wisdom can we impart to little old you today?
[1_Sneer_4] We are always glad to see our friends, the Humans, up on their hind legs.
[1_Sneer_5] Welcome, 'ally'. What do you need from us this time?

[1_Grovel_1] What do the powerful, yet benevolent, humans wish to speak to us mere mortals about today?
[1_Grovel_2] What would the humans, overlords of the galaxy, like to rap about today?
[1_Grovel_3] Greetings, O Great Humans! What can we humbly do for you today?
[1_Grovel_4] Hi! Glad to see you! Here's a big virtual hug!
[1_Grovel_5] Oh great ally, how can we help you in your cause to unite the galaxy?

[1_Greeting_2] What do you want?
[1_Greeting_1] What do you fleshlings wish to discuss today?
[1_Greeting_3] Well human, what business can we discuss on this day?
[1_Greeting_4] Oh, we may not look cuddly, but we love you so much that if you were really here we'd want to snuggle!
[1_Greeting_5] Greetings, Ally. How might we work together today?

[2_Sneer_1] What do our backwards, smelly, soft, distant, inbred human cousins wish to speak of today?
[2_Sneer_2] What do our future vassals want? Anything for you guys, I mean really...
[2_Sneer_3] Greetings, cousin. As a charity-loving civilization, we are always interested in talking to our inferiors.
[2_Sneer_4] Greetings. How can we help you today?
[2_Sneer_5] What aid can we provide to you today?

[2_Grovel_1] Warm greetings from your close, friendly, and caring galactic brothers. How can we work together to create a better future for one another?
[2_Grovel_2] Greetings, friends. We are willing to talk about anything you would like to talk about. The virtual floor is yours.
[2_Grovel_3] Greetings. Your humble and obviously related friends are always interested in discussing anything you might wish.
[2_Grovel_4] Hello, my friend. How may your galactic brothers be at your service today?
[2_Grovel_5] It is always great to see our galactic brothers. How might we work together to unite the galaxy today?

[2_Greeting_2] What do you want?
[2_Greeting_1] What can we do for you?
[2_Greeting_3] Hello! Always pleased to talk to you. What would you like to discuss today?
[2_Greeting_4] Greetings, friend. How can we help each other today? I've got some of those holo films you like so much!
[2_Greeting_5] Greetings, Ally. How might we work together today?

[3_Sneer_1] What does the talking monkey wish to speak to us about?
[3_Sneer_2] Yeeeeeeeees?
[3_Sneer_3] What does the talking monkey want today? Well, speak up!
[3_Sneer_4] Welcome. We are always pleased to give guidance to our friends.
[3_Sneer_5] How may we aid our cheese-eating, surrender-monkey allies today?

[3_Grovel_1] We are unworthy to even speak to you. Please let us know how we can be of service to the peaceful humans who we hope don't want to enslave us.
[3_Grovel_2] How can we be of service to the mighty Humans?
[3_Grovel_3] Greetings, O Great Humans. What can we humbly do for you today?
[3_Grovel_4] Greetings, human friends. We are always glad to talk to you.
[3_Grovel_5] We bid welcome to our human ally. What can we do to aid our united effort to bring the galaxy peace and justice?

[3_Greeting_2] What do you want?
[3_Greeting_1] What do you fleshlings wish to discuss today?
[3_Greeting_3] I greet you, human being. What items would you care to communicate to us today?
[3_Greeting_4] Greetings, friend. How can we help each other today?
[3_Greeting_5] Greetings, Ally. How might we work together today?

[4_Sneer_1] Sigh. What now? Didn't you see the sign on the comm panel?
[4_Sneer_2] Yes? If you have trouble speaking, try sounding out the words from your primitive terminal.
[4_Sneer_3] Speak.
[4_Sneer_4] Ah, our human friends. We hope you received our gift, a big red bouncing ball. Did you bounce the ball? We felt that such entertainments would amuse your kind.
[4_Sneer_5] You again. Well, since we're allegedly allies I suppose I should talk to you.

[4_Grovel_1] What do our god-like friends, the Humans, overlords of the universe who are aware that we were once brutally enslaved and would never want to see us pitiful beings enslaved again, wish from us today?
[4_Grovel_2] I don't feel I'm even worthy to speak to such great and powerful beings. But I will try my best. How may we humbly serve you?
[4_Grovel_3] How may we serve your whims today, oh great and powerful humans?
[4_Grovel_4] We are always happy to see our friends, the Humans, willing to speak to us lowly beings.
[4_Grovel_5] We welcome our most honorable, wonderful ally who we worship as a god. How might we serve our valiant cause? We are yours to command.

[4_Greeting_2] What do you want?
[4_Greeting_1] What do you fleshlings wish to discuss today?
[4_Greeting_3] Transmission open. State your intentions.
[4_Greeting_4] Greetings, friend. How can we help each other today?
[4_Greeting_5] Greetings, Ally. How might we work together today?

[5_Sneer_1] Fleshling creature. We have granted you this time speak to us. Use it wisely.
[5_Sneer_2] You organic creatures are inefficient at communication but we have granted you the honor of communication. Speak quickly.
[5_Sneer_3] You primitive humans always amuse us with your mouth flapping. What would you like to discuss today?
[5_Sneer_4] We are always amused to discuss things with our fleshling friends.
[5_Sneer_5] What does the parasite want?

[5_Grovel_1] What do the surprisingly powerful yet peace loving humans wish to convey to us machines?
[5_Grovel_2] What can we modest artificial beings do for the powerful humans today?
[5_Grovel_3] Greetings, powerful one. How can we help one another today?
[5_Grovel_4] Greetings, human. How can we assist you today?
[5_Grovel_5] Greetings, carbon-based ally.

[5_Greeting_2] Request for discussion acknowledged.
[5_Greeting_1] Yes?
[5_Greeting_3] Greetings. Topics of conversation are listed on your terminal.
[5_Greeting_4] Greetings, fellow sentient. What should we discuss today?
[5_Greeting_5] Greetings, Ally. How might we work together today?

[Generic_StarBaseThreat_1] I am going to be candid with you, %s. Your starbase, %s, located in sector %d, %d is too provocative to stay. It isn't mining a resource. It is building up its offensive weaponry. This is unacceptable to us. Give us the starbase or you will die.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_2] %s: We are monitoring the construction of %s in sector %d, %d. You seem to be behaving as if you are playing some sort of poorly designed strategy simulator. Let us be clear: We are sentient beings who are well aware of the primitive tactic of building up an offensive capability and then attacking. You will hand this starbase over to us. Or, we will destroy you utterly.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_3] Let me be succinct, %s. We know about the build up of your starbases to an offensive capability for your fleets. For instance, %s in %d, %d, is near our star system. It is not mining a resource. It is clearly there to build up for an attack. Clearly you have a low opinion of our strategic ability. So let us be clear: hand over the starbase or your civilization will be destroyed.

[Generic_StarBaseThreat_4] We are concerned about the starbase you are building (%s) in sector %d, %d. It is not mining any resource, but instead seems to be gaining a significant offensive capability. We ask that you cease this. Disbanding it would be a good first step.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_5] The starbase known as %s, located in sector %d, %d, is acquiring a significant offensive capability. We ask that you cease this construction immediately.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_6] When I was younger, I used to play strategy entertainment consoles. In these, 'games', as you call them, I would first build up my attack force around the unsuspecting computerized players. Then I would act. The computerized players were unaware of this. Human, we are not computerized players. We are a proud and ancient sentient civilization. %s, in sector %d, %d, is a threat to us. We ask that you disband this starbase immediately.

[Generic_StarBaseThreat_7] Greetings, friend. We are a little nervous about %s being built in %d, %d. We trust you are building this there to help ensure our mutual protection. But my military advisors are getting a little nervous.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_8] Hello human friend. Our state department has asked me to pass on our concern over the building of %s in sector %d, %d. It is gaining a considerable offensive capability.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_9] Greetings as always, friend. I've been asked to pass on to you our nervousness over the increasingly powerful %s being constructed in sector %d, %d. While we value our friendship with the humans, we are going to maintain a close eye on this this starbase.

[Generic_StarBaseThreat_10] Let me be frank, human. %s in coordinates %d, %d, is offensive to us. We recognize cultural conquest when we see it. You will hand over this starbase immediately or we will destroy you.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_11] Human, you obviously believe us to be naive. We recognize that %s in sector %d, %d exists to try to sway our people against us. It will not work. Why? Because you are about to hand over that starbase now or you will be my personal slaveling.
[Generic_StarBaseThreat_12] Earth creature, make no mistake, %s located at %d, %d is unacceptable. It is a very obvious attempt to try to encourage defections. Since we assume you do not want war, you will hand this starbase over to us now.


[CryForHelp_1] Hello friend. We are slowly being destroyed by the %s. Is there anything you can do to help us?
[CryForHelp_2] The war against the %s is going badly. My advisors have informed me that they do not expect us to be able to hold out much longer. Is there anything you can do to help us?
[CryForHelp_3] Humans have always been friends to our people. The %s is gradually destroying our civilization. We plead for any help that you can provide.


[StarBaseThreatRejected_1] Then you will die, %s.
[StarBaseThreatRejected_2] Very well. Goodbye, %s. May your death be as painful as possible.
[StarBaseThreatRejected_3] Do you hear that, %s? It is the sound of your death. It is the sound of inevitability.

[HumanRejection_0] I must confess, we humans have focused too long with warring with only each other. Apparently you are interested in being included now?
[HumanRejection_1] Go to hell.
[HumanRejection_2] Nuts.
[HumanRejection_3] Oh? Well here's a message for you: Kiss. My. Ass.
[HumanRejection_4] How do I put this diplomatically, ah yes, cram it!
[HumanRejection_5] I'll see you in hell.
[HumanRejection_6] You obviously know little about humans. We've been killing each other for thousands of years. Do you really think you can intimidate us?
[HumanRejection_7] (Laughs). There's something you should know about us humans, we have a long history of war. Sadly, we're good at it. Very good at it.
[HumanRejection_8] I have skin flakes more impressive than you.
[HumanRejection_9] Explain to me the part where you apparently think we're supposed to be afraid.
[HumanRejection_10] We humans have been killing each other for eons. If you'd like to join our party, go right ahead.

[HumanRejection_11] I don't think this is something we can do right now.
[HumanRejection_12] This isn't something that is in our best interests.
[HumanRejection_13] Sorry, can't help you presently.


[StarShipBuildUp_1] Get those ships out of sector %d, %d or I'll remove them for you.
[StarShipBuildUp_2] The military build up in sector %d, %d is unacceptable. Get those ships out of there now.
[StarShipBuildUp_3] If you want to live, remove the military ships from sector %d, %d immediately.

[StarShipBuildUp_4] We are aware of the build up in sector %d, %d...
[StarShipBuildUp_5] The build up in %d, %d is something we consider a hostile act.
[StarShipBuildUp_6] Please remove your offensive ships from sector %d, %d.

[Human_Diplomacy_5] Now in communications with the ambassador of the %s.

[Human_Trade_Peace_Strong_1] Good god, we're just so kicking your ass. Now, look at the left and right sides of your terminal and we can discuss a peace treaty. Did I mention you guys just completely suck when it comes to war? I mean really, what the hell were you thinking fighting us? Hello!?
[Human_Trade_Peace_Strong_2] The war doesn't seem to be going so well for you. But we are prepared to sign an armistice today. Cause we're just that nice.
[Human_Trade_Peace_Strong_3] Greetings. This misunderstanding between us has caused great harm. We could crush your civilization but we are not without mercy. The time has come for us to set aside our differences and forge a better future.

[Human_Trade_Peace_Equal_1] Golly gee, the war really ain't goin' too well for either of us. Lots of explosions and stuff. Reminds me of the time I tried cooking a fire cracker in the nano-wave oven. Hoowie. Anywhoo, let's come to terms.
[Human_Trade_Peace_Equal_2] Let us come to terms to end this awful war.
[Human_Trade_Peace_Equal_3] Greetings. This misunderstanding between us has caused great harm. The time has come for us to set aside our differences and forge a better future.

[Human_Trade_Peace_Weak_1] Please stop hurting us! If you keep doing the stuff you're doing you'll conquer all our territory. Er, yea, I see that probably would be a good thing for you. But think of the children! Won't SOMEONE please think of the children?!
[Human_Trade_Peace_Weak_2] You have amply demonstrated your power. Perhaps there is a way we can end this destructive conflict?
[Human_Trade_Peace_Weak_3] Greetings, your Excellency. Your prowess on the battlefield knows no bounds. Let us celebrate your strength by agreeing to terms and constructing a new galactic order based on your strength, wisdom and most importantly, mercy.

[Human_Trade_1] Hey alien, we are interested in trading stuff with you. Here's what we are thinking:
[Human_Trade_2] Greetings. We are interested in trading with you. We'd like to trade
[Human_Trade_3] Greetings, Excellency. On behalf of mankind we would like to trade

[Human_Trade] Greetings, your Excellency. On behalf of mankind, we would like to trade
[Human_Trade2] in exchange for
[Human_Give] Hello, friend. Our civilization would like to give you
[Human_Threat] On our world, it is customary for the weaker to give presents to the stronger. The gifts we would like from you include
[Human_Greeting] Very well.
[Human_Understand] Understood.
[Human_ThreatDumb] Even though you could crush us like a bug, we are going to demand that you hand over the following:
[Human_ThreatGood] In our effort to bring peace to the galaxy, we must ask you to donate self-lessly to our cause. Here is our list:
[Human_ThreatEvil] Well, slave race, we think you should provide your superior with some nice things. These, for instance:
[Human_Threat] We must ask that you provide our civilization with certain supplies:
[Alien_Reject_4] That doesn't seem like a very good deal to us.
[Alien_Reject_0] And this is a good deal HOW?
[Alien_Reject_1] Tap tap. Is this Universal Translator on? We must have missed the punch line. Why would we agree to this?
[Alien_Reject_2] I think not.
[Alien_Reject_3] This deal is unacceptable.

[Alien_Accept_3] Excellent. I am glad we could come to an agreement.
[Alien_Accept_0] This is satisfactory.
[Alien_Accept_1] This agreement will do nicely.
[Alien_Accept_2] It is done.

[Human_Accept] Great.
[Human_Rejection] Very well. Have it your way.
[Alien_NoExchange] Thank you.
[Human_NoExchange] Yeah, sure, anytime.


[MinorRaceWar] So the reckless humans have come to discuss peace with us?
[MinorRaceWantsPeace] Our civilization is what you'd call a 'minor race'. We do not have grand plans of galactic conquest. We simply want to live and let live. Let us come to terms.
[GenericThanks] We thank you for this generous gift.
[GenericScoff] Thanks for the gift but the war will continue.
[InsincereThanks] Ah more presents. Thank you.
[ThreatResponse_Default] We don't take kindly to threats, Earth-creature.
[SincereThanks] Thank you for your generous gift. I must confess that you humans know how to show the proper respect. We look forward to improved relations in the future.
[SincereThanksFriend] You humans are always so kind to us. Your excellent skills in diplomacy have convinced our leaders to improve our relations with your civilization.

[NewSubject_Default] Perhaps there is something else we can discuss.

[1_Welcome_Attacker_Losing_Default] So it would seem we miscalculated when we thought to... persuade your civilization to become one with us. What would you like to discuss?
[1_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default] From out vantage point, the war is not going too well for your kind. Are you hear to negotiate peace in your time?
[1_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_1] Your military is crushed and your economy can't sustain the effort. Your propaganda to your people becomes more desperate, I can only assume you are here to grovel?
[1_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_2] You are defeated. Beg now while you still have a tongue to beg with.
[1_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_3] Your life, as it has been, is over. From this point forward, you will service us. Are you prepared to bargain for that future now?
[1_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Default] You humans have attacked us and while our military is weak, our ancient civilization has survived much greater challenges.
[1_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Default] You pathetic humans foolishly attacked us. Now you come crawling here for peace I assume?
[1_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_1] We are losing this war. But make no mistake, we hate your civilization. Your pitiful 'strategy' of attacking us, making peace and then attacking us again disgusts us.
[1_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_2] While we are losing, but we are willing to fight against you to the bitter end. Your repeated attacks on us after having made peace show your true colors.
[1_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_3] Perhaps we are being destroyed. But we have honor, unlike you. We don't make peace only to reload our weapons and attack again.
[1_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_1] (Laughs). Ah yes, the humans think their pathetic 'strategy' of attacking, trying to take a few of our star systems, then coming and bribing us with peace so that they can build up again to attack us again will work? No, you will pay a high price for your lack of vision.
[1_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_2] So you thought you would just come and make a deal eh? That we would just make peace with you after you have repeatedly attacked us. Ah, the novice strategist thinks we'll just make peace while you organize for another attack and wear us down. Perhaps you should choose a different profession.
[1_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_3] Ho ho, humans. So pathetic. So predictable. Sure, you want us to make peace right? So you can build up and attack us again right? Is that your idea of a winning 'strategy'? (laughs)...





[2_Welcome_Attacker_Losing_Default] So it would seem we miscalculated when we thought to... persuade your civilization to become one with us. What would you like to discuss?
[2_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default] You hear that? It is the sound of your death. Do you really think you can defy what is inevitable?
[2_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_1] Have our weak human cousins come here to beg for our mercy? Our mercy may be obtainable for a price. A very high price...
[2_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_2] Have you come here to confess the awful truth, that ultimately all humans are nothing more than cheese eating surrender monkeys?
[2_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_3] We have studied your culture. I think the phrase to use now would be to say, we are most definitely kicking your ass.

[2_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Default] Sigh. So you have ruthlessly attacked your peace-loving galactic cousins. I'll not lie to you, you will probably win but we are a brave people. We are prepared to fight to the end if need be.
[2_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Default] It would seem you made a mistake when you ruthlessly attacked us. Now you are here to see if you can persuade us to forgive you?
[2_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_1] So our human cousins have come to once again ask for peace so that they can rearm, build up and attack again, take a few of our worlds maybe and then return? 
[2_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_2] Oh wait, let me guess. You want to make peace. Then you will move your ships into our sectors, build up, and then attack us, then once we've weakened you a bit, you'll come back here and ask for peace again? That sound about right?
[2_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_3] You humans are not much like us after all. When we make peace, we mean it. Usually anyway. You, on the other hand, use peace only to let your population come back so that you can continue attacks on us. 
[2_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_1] (Laughs). Ah yes, the humans think their pathetic 'strategy' of attacking, trying to take a few of our star systems, then coming and bribing us with peace so that they can build up again to attack us again will work? No, you will pay a high price for your lack of vision.
[2_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_2] So you thought you would just come and make a deal eh? That we would just make peace with you after you have repeatedly attacked us. Ah, the novice strategist thinks we'll just make peace while you organize for another attack and wear us down. Perhaps you should choose a different profession.
[2_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_3] Ho ho, humans. So pathetic. So predictable. Sure, you want us to make peace right? So you can build up and attack us again right? Is that your idea of a winning 'strategy'? (laughs)...



[3_Welcome_Attacker_Losing_Default] So it would seem we miscalculated when we thought to... persuade your civilization to become one with us. What would you like to discuss?
[3_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default] The time of your enslavement draws near.
[3_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_1] Bone flecked jam. That is the future I see for the human race if you are not able to grovel your way to peace today.
[3_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_2] Your head will look most excellent on a pike in my den. It will go well with my collection. But I am gentle being and am willing to delay that ultimate future if you are willing to pay a high enough price today.
[3_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_3] When we get done with you, you'll wish you had stayed up in the trees of East Africa where you belonged. Grovel now and we may let you live. Maybe.

[3_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Default] You humans have attacked us. And you appear to be winning. So what do you want from us?
[3_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Default] It would seem you made a mistake when you ruthlessly attacked us. Now you are here to see if you can persuade us to forgive you?
[3_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_1] We are losing this war. But make no mistake, we hate your civilization. Your pitiful 'strategy' of attacking us, making peace and then attacking us again disgusts us.
[3_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_2] (Laughs) Ah Humans. So you want to make peace with us after having attacked us. Peace will cost you a great deal more though. Every novice strategist knows the trick of making peace to regroup and then attack again.
[3_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_3] Perhaps we are being destroyed. But we have honor, unlike you. We don't make peace only to reload our weapons and attack again.
[3_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_1] (Laughs). Ah yes, the humans think their pathetic 'strategy' of attacking, trying to take a few of our star systems, then coming and bribing us with peace so that they can build up again to attack us again will work? No, you will pay a high price for your lack of vision.

Ah, the novice strategist thinks we'll just make peace while you organize for another attack and wear us down. Perhaps you should choose a different profession.
[3_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_3] Ho ho, humans. So pathetic. So predictable. Sure, you want us to make peace right? So you can build up and attack us again right? Is that your idea of a winning 'strategy'? (laughs)...



[4_Welcome_Attacker_Losing_Default] So it would seem we miscalculated when we thought to... persuade your civilization to become one with us. What would you like to discuss?
[4_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default] It would seem your destruction is at hand. Are you here to grovel for mercy?
[4_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_1] Our people are looking forward to being the slave masters for once.
[4_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_2] You humans are pitiful warriors. Maybe you are better at begging. Let's see how well you do.
[4_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_3] Pride. It is something that has caused even the best of us to fail. And you are no where near 'the best'. Don't let your pride get in the way of your begging today.


[4_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Default] Sigh. We are always the victims. Enslaved, beaten, crushed. Do you take pride in being so ruthless?
[4_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Default] It would seem you made a mistake when you ruthlessly attacked us. Now you are here to see if you can persuade us to forgive you?
[4_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_1] We are losing this war. But make no mistake, we hate your civilization. Your pitiful 'strategy' of attacking us, making peace and then attacking us again disgusts us.
[4_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_2] While we are losing, but we are willing to fight against you to the bitter end. Your repeated attacks on us after having made peace show your true colors.
[4_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_3] Perhaps we are being destroyed. But we have honor, unlike you. We don't make peace only to reload our weapons and attack again.
[4_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_1] (Laughs). Ah yes, the humans think their pathetic 'strategy' of attacking, trying to take a few of our star systems, then coming and bribing us with peace so that they can build up again to attack us again will work?

[4_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_2] So you thought you would just come and make a deal eh? That we would just make peace with you after you have repeatedly attacked us.

[4_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_3] Ho ho, humans. So pathetic. So predictable. Sure, you want us to make peace right? So you can build up and attack us again right? Is that your idea of a winning 'strategy'? (laughs)...



[5_Welcome_Attacker_Losing_Default] So it would seem we miscalculated when we thought to... persuade your civilization to become one with us. What would you like to discuss?
[5_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default] You are defeated. It is useless to resist. Don't make us destroy you utterly.
[5_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_1] The end of human civilization appears at hand. If it makes you feel better, we have found that humans can be converted to a paste-like substance that makes an excellent lubricant. If you fail, humanity will live on, sort of.
[5_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_2] Our research units are preparing their organ harvesting factories for converting humans to nutrients for our use. They will need to be compensated if you wish to avoid that future.
[5_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default_3] Sentient organic life forms generate a great deal of energy. We have great plans to grow humans in vast farms to harvest their energy. But there may be other alternatives if you are willing to pay the right price. But I doubt it.

[5_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Default] Are you interested in ending this war? Do so only if you want true peace and not merely to just attack us again in a few years.
[5_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Default] It would seem you made a mistake when you ruthlessly attacked us. Now you are here to see if you can persuade us to forgive you?
[5_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_1] We are losing this war. But make no mistake, we hate your civilization. Your pitiful 'strategy' of attacking us, making peace and then attacking us again disgusts us.
[5_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_2] While we are losing, but we are willing to fight against you to the bitter end. Your repeated attacks on us after having made peace show your true colors.
[5_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_3] Perhaps we are being destroyed. But we have honor, unlike you. We don't make peace only to reload our weapons and attack again.
[5_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_1] Carbon based life forms. They always underestimate the intelligence of artificial life. Will we make peace with you? The price will be very high since you are using predictable strategy #1042 in which opponent merely makes peace to rebuild to attack again and then repeat.
[5_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_2] Your limited intelligence has brought you to this state. The groveling you will need to provide to us will be great since we have identified your simple strategy of making peace, attacking, making peace, attacking and so forth.
[5_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_3] Let me spell this out, fleshling. We have little interest in peace at this point. We are not interested in having our empire picked off a planet or two at a time and then having peace made with us. 


[6_Welcome_Attacker_Losing_Default] So it would seem we miscalculated when we thought to... persuade your civilization to become one with us. What would you like to discuss?
[6_Welcome_Attacker_Winning_Default] Your military is crushed and your economy can't sustain the effort. Your propaganda to your people becomes more desperate, I can only assume you are here to grovel?
[6_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Default] You beings of flesh cannot be trusted. Your warlike ways make us wary of dealing with you in the first place. Now you have attacked us and seem to have the upper hand. What do you want?
[6_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Default] It would seem you made a mistake when you ruthlessly attacked us. Now you are here to see if you can persuade us to forgive you?
[6_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_1] We are losing this war. But make no mistake, we hate your civilization. Your pitiful 'strategy' of attacking us, making peace and then attacking us again disgusts us.
[6_Welcome_Defending_Losing_Hate_2] While we are losing, but we are willing to fight against you to the bitter end. Your repeated attacks on us after having made peace show your true colors.

[6_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_2] So you thought you would just come and make a deal eh? That we would just make peace with you after you have repeatedly attacked us. Ah, the novice strategist thinks we'll just make peace while you organize for another attack and wear us down. Perhaps you should choose a different profession.
[6_Welcome_Defending_Winning_Hate_3] Ho ho, humans. So pathetic. So predictable. Sure, you want us to make peace right? So you can build up and attack us again right? Is that your idea of a winning 'strategy'? (laughs)...



[1_Welcome_NewWar_Losing_Default] The war has just begun, yet you are already coming to make peace?
[1_Welcome_NewWar_Winning_Default] The war is fresh and glorious. We are confident of your extermination. You'll be hard pressed to convince us to end it so quickly.
[2_Welcome_NewWar_Losing_Default] Peace already?
[2_Welcome_NewWar_Winning_Default] The war has only begun. And you are probably doomed. We are interested in territory -- your territory.
[3_Welcome_NewWar_Losing_Default] The war has just begun.
[3_Welcome_NewWar_Winning_Default] You want peace already? If I were you, I would want that too but we are more interested in trying out our new military hardware.
[4_Welcome_NewWar_Losing_Default] What, your give peace a chance protesters have prevailed?
[4_Welcome_NewWar_Winning_Default] It doesn't take much to make you flinch does it?
[5_Welcome_NewWar_Losing_Default] We are not terribly interested in war but we do not trust your sudden desire for diplomacy.
[5_Welcome_NewWar_Winning_Default] Human kind is doomed to extinction. The war has only begun as far as we're concerned.




[2_WantsPeace_A] You humans are more powerful than we had expected. Our fleet is shattered. What do we need to do to bring about peace?
[2_WantsPeace_B] We bow to your superior military power. You have demonstrated your strength. What can we do to bring an end to this war?
[2_WantsPeace_C] While we loathe you, your friends, the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[2_WantsPeace_D] Our people are weary of this war. What can we do to return to peace?
[2_WantsPeace_E] It is true we have no love for you humans but bigger issues are at hand in the galaxy that we must deal with. We are open to a negotiated peace.

[3_WantsPeace_A] Human, this is an awkward moment for us. Remember how we ACCIDENTALLY attacked you awhile back? That is just how our species shows its love of other civilizations. Now that we're kind of, well, dying, we were wondering if you would have mercy on us?
[3_WantsPeace_B] Surely you don't want to see us destroyed? We are, somehow, related to you by our obvious similarities. Could you please stop destroying us now?
[3_WantsPeace_C] While we loathe you, your friends, the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[3_WantsPeace_D] We're not terribly fond of you but we have bigger things to rise to and have no more time to deal with your pesky interference.
[3_WantsPeace_E] It is true we have no love for you humans but bigger issues are at hand in the galaxy that we must deal with. We are open to a negotiated peace.

[G_WantsPeace_A] Well you see... it's like this: When we attacked you we were kind of, you know... hoping you'd die. But it seems you're now wiping the galactic floor with us so we were wondering if we could grovel for terms of peace?
[G_WantsPeace_B] What more do you want? We have secret weapons in preparation to a final battle with you. Let us end this war now that you began before it is too late.
[G_WantsPeace_C] We do indeed hate you. Unfortunately, the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[G_WantsPeace_D] We're not going to be good friends any time soon but the time has come to end this war.
[G_WantsPeace_E] We are now open to a negotiated peace. Other concerns have come up.

[4_WantsPeace_A] So, how's it going? When my advisors suggested that we attack you, they were kind of expecting that we would crush your civilization. Funny thing is, it turns out that well, crushing is going on but it's you crushing us. So, we were kind of wondering if you would be willing to make peace now?
[4_WantsPeace_B] Our economy is shattered, our empire is coming apart. What have we done to you to deserve this? We only wish peace and friendship with you. Please spare our civilization.
[4_WantsPeace_C] While we loathe you, your friends, the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[4_WantsPeace_D] This war is draining our civilization. While we despise you humans, the time has come to come to terms. Let us end this destructive conflict.
[4_WantsPeace_E] It is true we have no love for you humans but bigger issues are at hand in the galaxy that we must deal with. We are open to a negotiated peace.

[5_WantsPeace_A] You carbon based life forms resist being assimilated far more than we had calculated. We have concluded that we cannot assimilate you by force. We wish to end hostilities.
[5_WantsPeace_B] You have demonstrated to us quite clearly the superiority of your organic based species in warfare. Let us conclude a peace treaty.
[5_WantsPeace_C] While we loathe you, your friends, the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[5_WantsPeace_D] This war is draining precious resources from other vital interests of our empire. We wish to discuss terms to end the war.
[5_WantsPeace_E] Great deeds are happening at this moment elsewhere on the galactic plane that require our attention. Let us end this feeble conflict.


[1_WantsPeace_A] Well you see... it's like this: When we attacked you we were kind of, you know... hoping you'd die. But it seems you're now wiping the galactic floor with us so we were wondering if we could grovel for terms of peace?
[1_WantsPeace_B] Don't you think you've made your point? Your military has devastated our space navy and our economy is in desperate shape. What do you need to make peace?
[1_WantsPeace_C] While we loathe you, your friends, the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[1_WantsPeace_D] This war has been going on for a long while. While I am not fond of you, our people are weary of war. Let us come to terms.
[1_WantsPeace_E] It is true we have no love for you humans but bigger issues are at hand in the galaxy that we must deal with. We are open to a negotiated peace.

[7_WantsPeace_A] Ahem... well, so... the thing is... we are what you call a 'minor race'. You know, we really can't be held responsible for declaring war on you. So we were... kind of... you know, wondering if you would have mercy on us? Isn't our logo pretty?
[7_WantsPeace_B] Okay, you win. You squashed us. You're a big man. Woohoo. You showed us. Now, can we have peace? We're just a freaking minor race, cut us some slack.
[7_WantsPeace_C] We don't like you, but the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[7_WantsPeace_D] You deem us a minor race. We are finding ourselves over extended and really prefer to come to terms now. Our logo is making you sleepy... SLEEPY!
[7_WantsPeace_E] We would like peace. Please give it to us.

[8_WantsPeace_A] Ahem... well, so... the thing is... we are what you call a 'minor race'. You know, we really can't be held responsible for declaring war on you. So we were... kind of... you know, wondering if you would have mercy on us? Isn't our logo pretty?
[8_WantsPeace_B] Okay, you win. You squashed us. You're a big man. Woohoo. You showed us. Now, can we have peace? We're just a freaking minor race, cut us some slack.
[8_WantsPeace_C] We don't like you, but the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[8_WantsPeace_D] You deem us a minor race. We are finding ourselves over extended and really prefer to come to terms now. Our logo is making you sleepy... SLEEPY!
[8_WantsPeace_E] We would like peace. Please give it to us.

[9_WantsPeace_A] Ahem... well, so... the thing is... we are what you call a 'minor race'. You know, we really can't be held responsible for declaring war on you. So we were... kind of... you know, wondering if you would have mercy on us? Isn't our logo pretty?
[9_WantsPeace_B] Okay, you win. You squashed us. You're a big man. Woohoo. You showed us. Now, can we have peace? We're just a freaking minor race, cut us some slack.
[9_WantsPeace_C] We don't like you, but the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[9_WantsPeace_D] You deem us a minor race. We are finding ourselves over extended and really prefer to come to terms now. Our logo is making you sleepy... SLEEPY!
[9_WantsPeace_E] We would like peace. Please give it to us.

[10_WantsPeace_A] Ahem... well, so... the thing is... we are what you call a 'minor race'. You know, we really can't be held responsible for declaring war on you. So we were... kind of... you know, wondering if you would have mercy on us? Isn't our logo pretty?
[10_WantsPeace_B] Okay, you win. You squashed us. You're a big man. Woohoo. You showed us. Now, can we have peace? We're just a freaking minor race, cut us some slack.
[10_WantsPeace_C] We don't like you, but the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[10_WantsPeace_D] You deem us a minor race. We are finding ourselves over extended and really prefer to come to terms now. Our logo is making you sleepy... SLEEPY!
[10_WantsPeace_E] We would like peace. Please give it to us.

[35_WantsPeace_A] So... the thing is, another boy made me do it. I was just kidding around you know? Besides, I'm just a test civilization. I won't even be in the final game. So let me live. This beta is all the glory I get!
[35_WantsPeace_B] Yea, you kicked my ass. Probably cheated. Yea, go post on your precious message board. Now let's make a deal.
[35_WantsPeace_C] We don't like you, but the %s have been pressuring us to make peace with you. What do we need to do to come to terms?
[35_WantsPeace_D] I have powers you know? POWERS. Political powers! So let's make peace now. You have impressed me and it takes much to impress me. Whoa! That dog has a fluffy tail!
[35_WantsPeace_E] Give us peace or I will sing songs from the Phantom of the Opera sound track. 'Night time sharpens... heightens each sensation...' I'll keep doing that until we make peace.

[BlackmailReject_1] Do the humans think of us as their own private bank that they can simply come to constantly to get a withdrawal?
[BlackmailReject_2] Did you not recently come to us asking for tribute? We do not wish to fight you but we will not bankrupt ourselves to serve you.
[BlackmailReject_3] It would not be in our best interests to continually supply the human war machine with revenue. Even though we've given you gifts in the past, it is not something we wish to continually do.

[BlackmailAccept_1] It appears we have no alternative but to do as you... request.
[BlackmailAccept_2] Fine. We didn't want those things anyway!
[BlackmailAccept_3] Very well. But we will not forget your threats.
[Blackmail_Accept_EvilHuman_GoodAlien] We will do as you demand. But know this, one day the good civilizations of the galaxy will stand up to you.
[Blackmail_Accept_GoodHuman] So is this the type of behavior one can expect to see from the so-called honorable humans?
[Blackmail_Accept_EvilAlien] Using your power to blackmail us is something we can appreciate. However, your time to die will come. Remember those words. I wouldn't bother putting anymore money away for retirement either.
[Blackmail_Accept_Default] So it has come to this. The humans gave the galaxy hyper-drive technology as a gesture of peace but now that you have tasted power you demand tribute. \n \n Very well. We shall give you tribute, but beware human, the price may be high in the long-run.

[BlackmailRejectWeaker_1] Though we admire your military might, our people will not give in to your extortion!
[BlackmailRejectWeaker_2] Our civilization was thriving while you humans were still hunting and gathering. You may be stronger than us now in some ways, but you are not nearly powerful enough for us to give in to your demands.
[BlackmailRejectWeaker_3] I think not, Earth-creature. While some say that your power is destined to rule the galaxy, we will resist aiding you in that quest while we are able.

[BlackmailRejectStronger_1] This must be some sort of joke. Your military power is not sufficient to carry out any sort of threats as far as we're concerned.
[BlackmailRejectStronger_2] I don't think so.
[BlackmailRejectStronger_3] We laugh at your threats. We have no use for you or your pitiful threats.

[ThreatResponseHumanStrongEco] Your military is in no position to carry out threats. While we admire your potential military power, it is just that, potential.

[TributeDemand_Default] Your military power is inadequate to defend yourselves in this hostile galaxy. We suggest you provide us with %d bc so that we can protect you -- from us.

[Rejected_Response_1] You will suffer for your imprudence.
[Rejected_Response_2] You won't live to regret this.
[Rejected_Response_3] You have chosen poorly, human.
[Rejected_Response_4] So be it. You will be sorry.
[Rejected_Response_5] You are braver than you look.
[Rejected_Response_6] So the monkey boy has some back bone. Interesting.

[Rejected_Response_7] Very disappointing.
[Rejected_Response_8] We had expected more cooperation from our so-called friends.
[Rejected_Response_9] Your unilateralism is threatening our friendship.


[Accepted_Response_1] You have made a wise decision.
[Accepted_Response_2] You have chosen wisely. You will continue to live, on your knees.
[Accepted_Response_3] Thank you for donating to our galactic conquest fund.
[Accepted_Response_4] You may continue to live... for now.
[Accepted_Response_5] Good work you cheese eating surrender monkey!
[Accepted_Response_6] You have chosen to live.

[Accepted_Response_7] We appreciate it.
[Accepted_Response_8] Thank you.
[Accepted_Response_9] We are grateful for your gift.

[Espionage_WarStart] Our intelligence sources within the %s tell us that they have declared war on the %s.
[Espionage_WarEnd] Our operatives working in the %s tell us that they and %s have made peace.
[Espionage_WarEnd2] Our operatives working in the %s tell us that they have managed to negotiate a peace agreement with the %s despite their losses.

[Human_Grovel_Good] I guess we don't have much choice in the matter. We have done as you asked.
[Human_Grovel_Evil] You may have gotten what you want this time, but we will feast on your entrails one day.

[Human_StarBaseConcern_1] Oh you can trust us...
[Human_StarBaseConcern_2] We're just building it for defensive purposes.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_3] It's nothing to be worried about.

[Human_StarBaseConcern_4] You can whine all you want, but there's not much you can do about it.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_5] If we wanted to destroy you, you'd know it.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_6] So what are you going to do? Cry?

[Human_StarBaseConcern_7] Well too bad.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_8] Tough.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_9] We're big. We're tough. Whatcha going to do about it?

[Human_StarBaseConcern_10] Oh those things? They're for a um, movie we're making.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_11] We just like to build up our starbases. It's a bit of a hobby.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_12] Gotta keep those defense contractors busy you know.

[Human_StarBaseConcern_13] No need to be concerned.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_14] We have galactic defense obligations to meet.
[Human_StarBaseConcern_15] When you're as powerful as we are, you can't be too careful.


[Human_Warning_1] Thanks for the information.
[Human_Warning_2] Believe me, we know this.
[Human_Warning_3] We're doing our part.

[Human_Warning_4] Perhaps, but they are also our friends.
[Human_Warning_5] We have good relations with them, but we'll take your message under advisement.
[Human_Warning_6] They are our friends, but we will heed your warning.

[Human_HelpResponse_1] Let me see if there's anything we can do to help you.
[Human_HelpResponse_2] I will consult with my advisors as to whether we can help.
[Human_HelpResponse_3] If we can help, we will.

[Human_HelpResponse_4] Don't take this badly, but your cause is lost.
[Human_HelpResponse_5] Helping you would be a waste of resources, I'm afraid. You should let your people be aware that the end is near. I'll see if there's anything we can do to delay the inevitable.
[Human_HelpResponse_6] How can I put this delicately? You're probably doomed.

[AlienDestabilize] There are rumors that the %s are conducting a campaign of sabotage and destabilization. Their government denies this, but our intelligence says the evidence is mounting.
[AlienDestabilize2] There are rumors that the %s are covertly providing funds to rebels in the %s in order to lower their morale.

[Human_Reject_Good] No, I don't think we'll be doing that.
[Human_Reject_Evil] We have an old Earth saying: Kiss my ass.
[Human_Grovel_Good] Okay, here you go. Please don't hurt us.
[Human_Grovel_Evil] We'll give you what you demand but one day, we'll shove that tribute right down your throat.

[Human_Grovel_Friend] We are always willing to help out our friends.
[Human_Grovel_1] We'll do what you ask, just don't hurt us.
[Human_Grovel_2] Very well, we will do as you want.
[Human_Grovel_3] It is done. You will find that we are excellent collaborators.
[Human_Grovel_4] Okay, no need to be rude.

[Human_Grovel_0] As you wish.




[1_TributeDemand_1] Your civilization makes us laugh. If you would like to continue to exist, transmit %d bc to us immediately.
[1_TributeDemand_2] We are debating whether it is best to enslave your kind or exterminate you. If you would like to delay our final decision, provide us with %d bc now.
[1_TributeDemand_3] While many of our people want to conquer you and harvest your species for its organs (especially its delicious skin) I am a kinder, gentler being and would be satisfied with merely %d bc.
[1_TributeDemand_4] Your civilization is too poor to pay us enough to allow you to continue to exist. Therefore we ask that you hand over some of your technology to us and in exchange, we will let you live.
[1_TributeDemand_5] Your civilization is utterly worthless. We will allow you to take up valuable space in our galaxy if you hand over the star system %s.
[1_TributeDemand_6] Hello friend, our peace keeping efforts throughout the galaxy are expensive. We need you to help contribute to this by transferring %d bc from your treasury to ours.

[2_TributeDemand_2] We have laid claim over the territory you now occupy. Therefore we require some rent to continue utilizing the planets you're on. Hand over %d bc if you wish to live.
[2_TributeDemand_3] We don't see much use for your civilization other than as a revenue source. Give us %d bc if you wish to continue existing.
[2_TributeDemand_4] Your civilization is too poor to pay us enough to allow you to continue to exist. Therefore we ask that you hand over some of your technology to us and in exchange, we will let you live.
[2_TributeDemand_5] Since we must be related anyway, we are sure you won't mind handing over the star system %s to your betters. We'll take good care of it.

[6_TributeDemand_2] We are debating whether it is best to enslave your kind or exterminate you. If you would like to delay our final decision, provide us with %d bc now.

[StarbaseDiscuss_1] You must think us fools if you think we're going to allow you to construct starbases in our territory to pollute us with your culture. We expect you to stop doing this and pay us %d bc in damages so that we can counter your vile cultural influence. Hot pants, I mean really...
[StarbaseDiscuss_2] I suppose you thought that you'd just build rings of starbases in our sectors, add cultural exchange centers and use your propaganda to encourage our people to defect and we'd just sit there and take it? Your cheese tactic won't work on us. Hand over %d in damages and stop building starbases in our sectors!
[StarbaseDiscuss_3] We request that you cease building starbases in our sectors. The ideas and values of your culture are interfering are influencing our people in ways we do not like.
[StarbaseDiscuss_4] So you ignored our previous request to stop building starbases. Very well. The price has gone up. Hand over what we ask or we will destroy you.
[StarbaseDiscuss_5] Do you really think that our foreign policy is based on the decisions of some poorly made computer strategy game? We weren't kidding about stopping the starbase building. Now you will hand over a great deal more or face utter destruction.


[AlienTalk_2] The %s are covering the galaxy in a reign of sickness and darkness. The time to formally join together is not at hand. But we must work together covertly to oppose them. Make no mistake, they will crush us separately if we do not resist.

[AlienTalk_0] We are both evil. We understand that. But the %s ... well they are not evil. And thats a problem for us. They are a threat to our torture-loving ways. We must act together to ensure that the galaxy is filled with misery and pain as it should be.

[AlienTalk_1] We both seem to believe that evil shall ultimately triumph in the galaxy. As it should be. We must work together to crush opposition which means that the %s must be destroyed eventually. For now, we must act covertly but let us work towards that eventuality.

[AlienTalk_3] A new darkness is slowly covering the galaxy. I give that darkness a name: the %s. We must work together in secret to ensure the survival of our civilizations.

[AlienTalk_4] We feel you must be aware of the threat that the %s now represent. They control a significant portion of the galactic resources. Their starbases will one day tilt the galactic balance of power in their favor.

[AlienTalk_5] The %s threat is growing. I suggest we quietly supply arms and money to any who are actively at war with them. Hopefully we can help loosen their grip on the considerable number of galactic resources they control.

[InfluenceWorry_1] The influence of the %s is growing very strong. They build starbases that intentionally magnify their cultural influence. If you do not wish to become an appendage of their empire, I suggest you work with us to resist their domination.

[InfluenceWorry_2] Your cultural influence is becoming a real concern for us. We ask that you do not build cultural modules to your starbases in any sectors that we have star systems in.

[Alien_SuckUp_1] We admire your power and wish to offer you this gift in recognition of your greatness and peaceful nature!

[Alien_SuckUp_2] Your benevolence has won the admiration of our people and we would like to present you with this token of our good will towards you wonderful humans.

[ParaEarth] Mother Earth - the starting point of human galactic expansion.  While even the earliest homo-sapiens held an interest in the heavens, it wasn't until 20th century space programs that the human race got a taste of what was out there.  A series of communications between Humanity and the Arcean Empire led to the development of 'star gates', and later, to the hyper-drive.
[ParaVeryLowQuality] !Life Support Reqired: Maint. Costs much higher as a result +10bc per month +5bc per government level!A pathetic planet to say the least, %s leaves much to be desired. %s many citizens have declared it "The Hell-Hole of the %s Empire."  Sparsely populated, with little production worth... one would wonder why exactly the planet was colonized in the first place.
[ParaLowQuality] !Life Support Reqired: Maint. Costs much higher as a result! %s %s isn't that bad... well actually it is. This planet requires a life support generator which adds to our costs.  Sparse vegetation and water require the citizens to ration the essential materials to sustaining life. It's safe to say that nobody really enjoys living here.
[ParaMidQuality] A planet with promise, the citizens of %s hope for the best.  %s the colony is said to be capable of more, provided the right improvements get up and running.  With some tender love 'n' care, %s may turn into a pretty nice place to stay.  Otherwise, it's merely 'average'.
[ParaHighQuality] %s %s has become one of the nicer places to reside in the %s Empire.  An abundance of mineral-rich land, clean air, and fresh water... the planet has become the vacation spot of thousands, and home to even more citizens.
[ParaVeryHighQuality] Truly a paradise - if the Garden of Eden was a planet, %s would be it! %s to live here is the dream of all citizens within the %s Empire.
[ParaRevolt] Warning! A state of emergency has been declared on %s.  Recent protest groups have lead the way for a system-wide revolt.  Low morale amongst its citizens, coupled with the increased cultural pressure of the %s, has erupted in turmoil throughout the colony.  Something has to be done before the people break away for good!

[Gov0]      Imperial Government\n \n With all the power held by a single ruler, the Imperial government will offer the least amount of trouble with rebellious star systems.  Everyone obeys your rule, at the price of economic expansion.
[Gov0Good]  Imperial Government\n \n Bearing the weight of problems onto your shoulders, the Imperial Government allows you people to live an easy life.  Star systems will be unlikely to separate from your kind leadership and morale should stay high. However, the fruits of economic well-being won't ripen until more say is given to individual planetary leaders.
[Gov0Evil]  Imperial Government\n \n Your titanium grip holds your empire together. Tough rules and occasional displays of public torture keep your followers in line.  Star systems will be easy to control, but riches won't come until power is more evenly divided throughout the systems.

[Gov1]      Republic Government\n \n Some powers are given to planetary leaders, which increases productivity. There is also a slight possibility of planetary rebellion.
[Gov1Good]  Republic Government\n \n Some powers are given to planetary leaders, which increases productivity. There is also a slight possibility of planetary rebellion.
[Gov1Evil]  Republic Government\n \n Some powers are given to planetary leaders, which increases productivity. There is also a slight possibility of planetary rebellion. Which we can "deal" with if necessary.

[Gov2]     Democratic Government\n \n A majority of issues are dealt with by the planetary systems.  Being able to govern themselves raises the level of production, but keeping the people happy will become even more difficult.

[StoryLostQuickTitle] The %s's Speedy Demise
[StoryLostQuick] Through the ages, our galaxy has been the home of extraordinary events, but none as odd as the untimely extinction of the %s civilization. Wiped out before they could even crawl, the %s's have become one of the first unfortunate victims of the race for Universal Supremacy.  Perhaps it would have been wise for their leader, Emperor %s, to have consulted www.galciv.com for hints and tips on its forum.  But we shall never know, for the %s race has met its abrupt end.

[StoryLostTitle] The Rise and Fall of the %s Empire
[StoryLost] The %s race... a wise, long-lasting civilization.  Through the leadership of Emperor %s, theirs' was a race that held on until the end.  Going where no others could, standing up against the mighty %s until the last battle was lost, and the last life spent.  The history of the %s's is a story of love, hate, and the eternal quest for success. A story that will be passed on for years to come, but, alas, a story that has ended in heartache.  \n\nPerhaps an easier difficulty setting next time?

[StoryMilitaryVictoryTitle] The Glorious Might of the %s Empire!
[StoryMilitaryVictory] Paving the way to victory in the blood of their enemies, the %s Civilization has emerged from the galactic race victorious. Their score is one that will most likely be logged in the Metaverse, inspiring other would-be leaders for years to come!  On the shoulders of his troops, Emperor %s will be raised and remembered as the greatest leader throughout the galaxy, spreading the culture of his nation to the farthest reaches of the galaxy... no matter who stands in his way.

[StoryAlliancesVictory] The human race has achieved a truly remarkable diplomatic victory. Through a series of treaties, the entire galaxy is now united in a peaceful way. Who knows what great things the United Galaxy can achieve. Congratulations for a great victory for your people and the rest of the galaxy!
[StoryCulturalVictory] We have conquered the galaxy. The %s won not with weapons but with ideas. Over the centuries leading human foods, clothing, and philosophies have won the battle of ideas. While we do not formally control the galaxy in any sort of legal or military sense, no one can ever conceive of a day when the galaxy would even consider not bending to our will. The galaxy looks to us for their progress into the future. Without our entertainment and our latest fashions and our restaurants and vacation resorts, their lives would, to them, seem empty and pointless. We have won a cultural victory. All praise %s!
[StoryCulturalDefeat] We have suffered a cultural defeat. \n \n As our youth began to wear the clothing styles of the %s parents and politicians made a great deal of noise. Over the years, the entertainment we watched, the sports we played, the food we ate and things we drank all seemed to come from the %s. \n \n It was a slow subtle thing. Who is to say one what day our culture was no longer our own. That our philosophies, views on life, and very ways of living were overwhelmingly influenced by a distant place. Our people, like the rest of the galaxy, cannot imagine a world where the %s are not part of our daily lives. \n \n While we are not united with them officially, we are, in effect, their vassals. \n \n This message has been brought to you by Slurm Cola. The leading beverage of the %s and therefore the galaxy.

[StoryTechWin] The scientists of the %s, successors to those who first brought hyper-drive to the galaxy, have now brought us the ultimate technological achievement.  They have guided the evolution of the human race past the barrier that separates man from god.
[StoryTechLoss] The scientists of the %s have made the invention of hyper-drive look like making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  They have used their superior technological knowledge to control the evolution of their people, who are now as gods. All shall tremble before their greatness.

[DemoOver] You know how they say space and time are infinite? Not in this demo. You've managed to survive this long. Perhaps if you had the full version, you might have brought the human race to dominate the entire galaxy. So, are you going to go through the rest of your life wondering what might have been, or are you going to get the full version and find out?

[StoryRetire] Weary of the strife and intrigue that inevitably comes with the running a great empire, Emperor %s has set aside the reins of power.  The future of the %s is now more uncertain than ever, lacking leadership, and the other civilizations are now eyeing the holdings of the %s with greed.  But, that is a story for another day...

[NoTrade] The freighter is met by alien star-craft as it lowers into the planet's atmosphere.  The pilots inform the crew that while the visitors are welcome, their merchandise is not. \n \n Apparently warnings of a universal trade embargo against those who disband the United Planets Council weren't just threats.
[MonsterParkBreakout] !! ALERT !! \n After a severe electrical storm on %s, several gates at the Space Monster Theme Park have malfunctioned, allowing the creatures to escape! \n All available spacecraft are required to terminate the deadly beasts at any cost!

[DidntGetTechs] Unfortunately, despite the ruling passed by the United Planets Council, we have received no new technology in the universal trade-off.  Apparently we were too far advanced for the other races to supply us with anything of use. However, the other civilizations cleaned up. Yippee.

[LowLevelReached] %s Espionage Level Reached - Low \n \n Using the funds dedicated to gathering information on the %s, we've been able to both intercept messages on private channels and bribe low-ranking government officials.  Even though our knowledge of their government infrastructure is sparse, it's better than no information at all.
[MediumLevelReached] %s Espionage Level Reached - Medium \n \n Using deciphered encryption methods, patches into neuro-networks, and human agents working within their government, our information on the %s has flourished.  We now have knowledge of all abilities held by their race, along with additional economic statistics.
[HighLevelReached] %s Espionage Level Reached - High \n \n The hand of our espionage forces has reached even further into the %s. We currently have substantial links with over 20%% of their government.  In addition, several stellar-communication probes have been positioned around their stars, sending us a majority of their most vital information.
[SuperLevelReached] %s Espionage Level Reached - Advanced \n \n With cash spent on espionage reaching well into the Trillions, our knowledge of their workings exceeds even that of head officials in their own government.  We now have spies in all facets of the %s. From Trade to Military, there is no shred of information that we won't have knowledge of!

[StolenTech] Our agents have just notified us that they have stolen information relating to the technology %s from the %s. The information will be in the hands of our scientists and engineers before the end of the day, so that we may begin to utilize this information immediately.

[FailedToStealTech] Some of our agents were nearly caught trying to steal technology from the %s.  Luckily for them, the managed to escape detection, but they were unable to obtain any useful data.

[NoTechToSteal] Agents were sent to the main research labs of the %s, but they were unable to find any useful data, as the %s have no technology that we do not already possess.

[CaughtStealingTech] Some of our agents were caught trying to steal technology from the %s.  Needless to say, the %s is quite annoyed with us, and our diplomatic relations with them are sure to suffer.

[ScreenTitle] Yearly Report - %s %d
[PollTitle] Top %lu %s Civs

[0_Title] A Journey Begins
[0_Message] It has been 8 years since scientists from the 'Freedom To Innovate' Corporation made public the practical engineering designs on how to build hyper-drive. The immense star gates that once allowed diplomatic couriers to travel between one capital star system and another have been dismantled and communication with other civilizations has come to an end. While we were able to communicate with other civilizations in a very limited way, any sort of realistic communication will require the development of a universal translator. \n \n We do not know where the other civilizations are located. No doubt they are, like us, building colony ships to try to claim as many star system as they can. Unlike us, however, they have been interstellar civilizations for thousands of years and their unmanned probes have long scanned the galaxy. While we know where the stars are, we cannot tell which stars hold Earth-like planets. \n \n Hopefully the fact that they owe us for their ability to colonize planets in the first place via human hyper-drive technology they will be friendly. Only time will tell.

[1_Title] An early status report
[1_Message]Our scientists believe that Earth-like planets are much more likely to be in orbit of yellow stars. They have also come up with a scale for rating planet quality. The higher the rating, the better the planet. The ratings are listed by the planet in the star system read-out. A class 15 planet or higher is suitable for colonizing. We can colonize any planet, but anything less than 15 will result in very little productive use.

[2_Title] Interstellar war
[2_Message] The galaxy has become an increasingly violent place. The %s and the %s are at war. The %s seem to be winning the war. The %s will need help to survive or hope for mercy from their enemies.

[3_Title] Human Ascension
[3_Message] Our war with the %s seems likely to bring a victory for us. The %s economy is not likely to be able to sustain itself against our military might. The war has been going on for quite awhile and it's not known how much longer it will take to reach final victory. \n \n According to reports, our military might (our fleet's attack + defense) is rated at %d while theirs is only at %d.

[4_Title] Twilight of humanity?
[4_Message] Critics charge that the war against the %s is going badly. They say this because the combination of their economic might and military power outclasses ours at present. Our population begins to fear for the future of our race.\n \n Earth Today Magazine published yesterday an article pointing out that if you took the economic rating of the %s and combined it with their military rating and compared it to ours it would be %d for them and %d for us. Clearly this is chilling news.

[5_Title] The technology gap grows...
[5_Message] Travelers of the galaxy are reporting that we are falling behind technologically. For instance, in the past year we have only produced %d percent of the research going on in the galaxy of the major space faring civilizations. This is a trend we will want to make sure we resolve soon if possible say experts.

[6_Title] A growing civilization
[6_Message] Over the past year we've seen our civilization's population dramatically increase. Today it stands at a resounding %3.1f billion people. Considering that only a year ago it was at %3.1f billion that is pretty staggering growth. Of course, critics of this report point out that people can't possibly be born at that rate and that what we're really seeing is a greater number of people reporting taxes to the government due to newly colonized worlds starting to prosper. \n \n Regardless of the causes, we have %3.1f billion more people than we had before paying taxes.

[7_Title] Alliances in action
[7_Message] The %s and the %s are now united. This has significant ramifications for us since an attack on one will mean an attack on both. Given their one could describe their moral alignment as %s (most observers consider us to be a '%s' civilization), we can only imagine how this will impact the galaxy as we move forward.

[8_Title] Galactic Resources
[8_Message] As we've explored the galaxy we've come across different galactic resources. These resources are sometimes part of cluster of comets. Sometimes they're on a runaway planetoid. Other times they're just strange anomalies that we have yet to fully understand. Constructors, when they intersect with one, can build starbases that harvest the unique properties of these resources. More constructors can increase our mining abilities as well as impact other aspects of the entire sector.

[9_Title] Human Progress
[9_Message] The %s continue to progress. The %s statistics agency has rated us a %d in our military strength (we ideally want a rating of 100 or higher to be militarily competitive) while our economy is rated at %d. Meanwhile, we control %d percent of the galactic resources that we are aware of.

[10_Title] Deficit Spending
[10_Message] Interest on our debts now accounts for %d percent of our GNP. This is something we should really take a look at. Purchasing social projects and starships is a good way to build up fast but we must be careful not to damage our long term economy.

[11_Title] The Military Industrial Complex
[11_Message] Protesters are unhappy that our military spending has grown out of proportion to our means. Specifically, we now spend %d billion credits (bc) per month just to maintain our current fleet. Considering that our taxes bring in only %d bc, this is something to take quite seriously.

[12_Title] The War Report
[12_Message] After %d months of war, our analysts say that our military strength has changed by %d percent. Meanwhile, our enemies, the %s, have seen their military strength change by %d percent. Economically, our income at the start of the war was %d bc per month (now its %d bc per month). The %s economy was %d bc per month at the start and is %d bc now.

[13_Title] Election Preview
[13_Message] Polls show that %s has an approval of %d percent. Under a Galactic Republic, Democracy, or Federation Earth's colonies gain increasing amounts of say in the senate which makes it harder for our leader to maintain a majority in the senate. Things are currently looking favorable for the %s.

[14_Title] Interstellar Trade
[14_Message] Trade between civilizations can bring in vast amounts revenue for the government via taxation of those trade routes. In essence, the government charters a freighter (by building a freighter) and sends it to a destination star system. From then on, the private sector picks up the route and sends it back and forth. \n \n The number of trade routes is very limited. This is because civilizations tend to be very... concerned with competition from alien products and services. Through technology, we can find ways to persuade other civilizations to ease these restrictions. \n \n The further away a trade route is, the more valuable it is. However, the amount a trade route brings in per month increases the further along the route the mini-freighter is.

[15_Title] Interstellar Influence
[15_Message] As our population grows and we open up our society to other civilizations, our influence grows. It is really the battle of ideas. Each civilization believes its way is the best way to live. We can build starbases with various modules added on that will expose other civilizations in the sector to our way. \n \n Sometimes if the influence of one civilization in a sector is so great, the people of other civilizations will rise up and defect to that civilization. It is something we must remain keenly aware of from both an offensive and defensive point of view.

[16_Title] Trade Wars
[16_Message] Trade can be the life blood of the galaxy. Ironically, alien civilizations trade more with us than we do with them. \n \n We do %d percent of the total trading in the galaxy. But alien civilizations send us %d billion credits each month more than what we send out.

[17_Title] %s - The Galactic Trading Empire
[17_Message] We lead the galaxy in trade: %d percent of all trade in the galaxy is done by us. We have a trade surplus of %d billion credits (bc) each month. Members of the trade federation have been praising the policies of %s as building peace and understanding between us and alien civilizations.

[18_Title] The Secret of Galactic Trading
[18_Message] In order to trade with other civilizations, we must find a way to negotiate with them. Our scientists say that the key to this is to learn about interstellar communication theory. Once we have that, the path to diplomacy should be readily accessible and from there, the art of trade. Once we achieve this understanding, we will have the ability to negotiate trade routes with other civilizations and help build our economy.

[19_Title] Culture Wars
[19_Message] When a given civilization's influence outshines all others, the sector map changes to that civilization's color. We can monitor just how strong that influence is by clicking on the button next to the sector readout (top right). A civilization with less than a rating of 100 is not very well known. Anything over 500 means it is a 'house hold' name. Those are the civilizations that may represent a threat to our way of life. \n \n If the difference between their civilization and our civilization in a given sector in which we own star systems grows beyond a couple hundred points in their advantage, we have serious cause for concern. It means that the youth of our society is probably beginning to take on the fashions, music, and tastes of that civilization rather than their own. At some point, if the difference becomes too great, they'll cease to even identify with their native civilization and clamor to become part of that alien civilization. \n \n And that is really the problem, at a certain point, they see their native civilization as alien and no longer wish to be bound by its laws and customs.

[20_Title] Culture Wars: Status Report
[20_Message] We have %d percent of the overall galactic influence. If virtually the entire galaxy falls under the influence of a dominate culture, that civilization becomes the hegemon of the galaxy since no civilization would be able to muster an effective military resistance at that point. Our statisticians are calculating this value based on sector influence, not just planetary influence. Build starbases with cultural exchange centers to increase this.

[21_Title] The Alliance against humanity
[21_Message] Many critics charge that the wars against us are slowly wearing us down. While they concede that we are more powerful than any particular enemy, when their power is combined, they create a lethal power against us. \n \n According to the institute for military studies, our military might strength (value of all our starship's attacks and defenses combined) is calculated to be %d. Meanwhile, our enemies, when combined, have a rating of %d. It may be time to try to make peace with some of our enemies so that we can concentrate on winning the war.

[22_Title] A strange galaxy
[22_Message] While the %s are not at war with anyone, they are certainly not well liked.

[23_Title] End of a would-be hegemon?
[23_Message] The %s are more powerful than any other civilization militarily, but it would seem that their enemies may have the last laugh. According to reports, the %s are finding that their enemies, while scattered, are slowly wearing them down.

[24_Title] Fall of the %s?
[24_Message] Reports are coming in that the %s are suffering death by a thousand cuts. While still stronger than any single one of their enemies, the %s have found their military and economic strength sapped to the breaking point by wars against too many foes.

[25_Title] %s vs %s
[25_Message] Military experts now suggest that the %s is winning the war against us. They have concluded this based on looking at the current military and economic power of the %s (%d) versus ours (%d). \n \n While there isn't panic on the streets as a result yet, there is a growing concern that human civilization may be threatened.

[26_Title] %s: The new galactic tyrants?
[26_Message] The %s are well on their way to defeating the %s. With their military and economic power, there is little hope for the %s at this point.

[27_Title] All is well
[27_Message] The good news is, other than the occasional criminal element or unfortunate anomaly, things are relatively quiet for the humans.

[28_Title] The %s pursue peace.
[28_Message] While there may be wars and other events in the galaxy, the %s seem to be intent on trying to get along with others (or at the very least keep their enemies so under thumb as to be irrelevant). Sources say that they are currently pursuing an economic and cultural strategy for being a galactic power. They are currently researching %s, for instance.

[29_Title] Status Report
[29_Message] The galaxy is a relatively quiet place. With few civilizations vying for power, things are much more concentrated in the hands of a few. \n \n The humans are currently considered a %s civilization with a military rating of %d and an economic rating of %d. For reference, a value of 100 or higher is considered to be ideal. We have %d colonies and our leader, %s, has an approval rating of %d. We currently receive %d per month due to freighters which have arrived from other civilizations.

[30_Title] An unhappy electorate
[30_Message] The popularity of %s is rather low. In a recent survey, only %d percent of the public approved of the job %s is doing. Come next election, his political party, the %s is likely to lose control of the senate which will cause some significant penalties to his policies.

[31_Title] An unhappy dictator
[31_Message] %s may not have to answer to the senate (since we have not recognized our colonies as having independent voting rights yet -- need Diplomacy technology for that). But the people are pretty unhappy with %d percent expressing an approval for the policies of %s. \n \n Public approval is a tricky thing. Even for the best of leaders, anything over 50 percent is considered good. Approval can be found in one of two ways -- you can decrease taxes which will make people happier, or you can provide more social programs such as stadiums, multimedia centers, entertainment networks, news networks, etc.

[32_Title] The Political Process
[32_Message] Having colonies is a tricky thing. At some point, there is a great advantage to allowing our colonies to have an equal voice. We surmise that there are different types of governments that can adequately handle this. \n \n First we have an Imperium. That is essentially where Earth dictates directly to the colonies. The senate is controlled by the Earth party which in this case is the %s. \n \n Eventually we can get a Republic, Democracy, and Federation. These forms of government provide increasing amounts of independence which in turn provide increasing amount of economic activity. \n \n The downside is that as our colonies become more independent, it becomes harder and harder to maintain control of the senate. Different planets will want us to have different policies. The best way to keep them happy is to keep our taxes low. But funding the building of social programs on those planets can also increase approval. \n \n Approval tends to decrease as the population increases. That's because the more people you have using the available facilities, the more disgruntled they get.

[33_Title] Research & Development
[33_Message] Each of our colonies produces some level of research. We can control this globally from our domestic policy screen. Many pundits believe that humanity's unique ability is through technology. It is, after all, our invention of hyper drive that has given birth to this new era of space exploration. While other civilizations may have split the atom thousands of years ago, once we hit our stride, we humans seem to have made up for lost time. \n \n There is a great debate in scientific circles over what we should research. Communication theory provides a path to diplomacy and interstellar business and trade. On the other hand, weapons and defense are pretty important too if we're to defend ourselves. And of course, increasing our propulsion technologies not only enables our ships to go faster, they create a whole set of derivative technologies that can help us mine galactic resources. Manufacturing technologies allow us to build things faster and cheaper than previously. Which path to take is up to our leader.

[34_Title] Human Production.
[34_Message] Our industrial capacity is very finite. Building factories and manufacturing plants and power plants can increase this capacity. From our domestic policy screen, we can adjust what percentage of that capacity we want to tap. \n \n Economists argue that a well run economy will always have untapped manufacturing capacity. That is, that if we put our spending rate to 100 percent that we would have deficit spending. However, in an economy that is light on industrial technologies, you can actually end up still having a net positive balance of income versus expense even though you are using 100 percent of your manufacturing capacity. \n \n When that happens, it means we need to build more factories and power plants.


[35_Title] Technology Update
[35_Message] A recent panel of scientists have rated our overall technology rating to be %d. Ideally, we want to be rated at 100 or higher if we are to keep up in technology. We are currently doing an estimated %d percent of the total research occurring.


[36_Title] Building an Empire
[36_Message] The galactic civilizations are expanding out into the galaxy in varying ways. The %s, for instance, have a reported technology rating of %d (the higher, the more advanced) while we have one of %d. Their approval rating with their people is %d percent. And militarily they claim to be rated at %d (100 or higher is good).

[37_Title] Status Report
[37_Message] Humans currently represent %3.1f percent of the galactic population while doing %d percent of the research. \n \n Our military rating is at %d (100 or higher is good). Our technology rating is %d and our economic rating is %d. \n \n Our military is currently using up %d percent of our income to maintain. \n \n Our population has changed by %3.1f billion over the past year. Our approval with the people is at %d percent.

[38_Title] Trade Status Report
[38_Message] Our trade minister is reporting the status of our trade with other civilizations. The first value is how much trade we are doing with them. The second value is the amount of trade they are doing with us.

[39_Title] Our story so far...
[39_Message] In the late 22nd century humans had built their first colony ship and had gone out into the galaxy. We are now in the year %d and here is where things stand...
[39_Message_A] We are not at war with any of the major civilizations.
[39_Message_B] We are at war with the %s but we are also currently stronger than they.
[39_Message_C] The %s is slowly grinding down our civilization in a deadly war.
[39_Message_D] We're doing okay technologically.
[39_Message_E] We have fallen behind technologically.
[39_Message_F] The consensus is that we are the most powerful civilization in the galaxy.
[39_Message_G] The %s is the most powerful civilization and they %s.
[Feeling_5] love us
[Feeling_1] hate us
[Feeling_4] are our friends
[Feeling_2] don't like us
[Feeling_3] haven't decided how they feel about humans yet
[Feeling_0] don't even know about us
